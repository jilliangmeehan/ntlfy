  intro:
    topic: changing seasons
    jillian: When I played Animal Crossing today, the snow had finally melted to
      reveal grayish-green grass, a sign that spring is coming to my little
      video game island. In real life, too, the snow has mostly melted away.
      This week has been warmer and sunnier—I can go outside without having to
      shove my hands inside my pockets. I’m hungry for warm weather, for shorts
      and sweatshirt weather, for walks-in-the-park weather. I think we’re
      almost on the other side.
    summer: I’ve been GOING OUTSIDE lately. Since I live in Southern California, it
      has less to do with the temperature being bearable and more to do with how
      long it’s bright out. I have been trying to take meetings outside.
      Yesterday, after work, I painted in the sun at 5PM. I was so happy to
      still have some daylight after work. I forgot how much winter affects me,
      especially with a specific work schedule—I am not someone who prioritizes
      doing things like “getting Vitamin D,” but the season change is so, so
      welcome because it means I have more opportunities to do the basic,
      healthy thing.

    title01: Tony’s Chocolonely
    desc01: "I think this is my first memory of eating [this
      chocolate](https://tonyschocolonely.com/us/en): early in the pandemic, my
      partner put a giant chocolate bar into our grocery cart and said he had
      tried it before, and it was good. I was like, ok, I love chocolate, let’s
      go. And it was the best chocolate I’d ever had! We realized they carried
      it at the market near my apartment, too, it became a snacky staple. This
      is honestly my favorite chocolate, I will eat a whole bar throughout the
      course of the day and only feel a little gross. The [mix-ins are
      absolutely
      spectacular](https://tonyschocolonely.com/us/en/chocoshop/product/milk-ca\
      ramel-sea-salt-32-1). The chocolate is also ethically sourced! Highly
      recommend for something sweet to look forward to."

    title02: Ace Attorney Trilogy
    desc02: These games are old and thus have been on my radar for years. I have
      friends who love them dearly and because of an [eShop
      sale](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-switch/) at
      the beginning of this year, I have joined them! These games are so campy!
      The writing is so silly! I love to have fun. They fully engrossed me in
      the 40ish hours it takes to play through the games available for Switch—I
      finished everything maybe in the second week of January and I haven’t been
      able to stop thinking about them! I’m begging Capcom to put the rest of
      the games on Switch, but you can play literally any of them on your phone,
      your computer, your PlayStation, your 3ds. Anything!

    title01: Ikenfell
    desc01: I bought [this game](https://www.humblegames.com/games/ikenfell/) last
      year and never finished playing it because I got distracted by other
      things—but I picked it back up a couple of weeks ago and I’ve really been
      loving it. It’s a cute, magical indie RPG with a great soundtrack and lots
      of queer characters, and there’s really nothing not to like about that as
      far as I’m concerned. It’s also really forgiving to players who want to
      make the battles a little easier (or just skip them altogether in favor of
      experiencing the story) which I always love to see.

    title02: Lofi video game music
    desc02: These days I’m pretty much incapable of getting any work done if I’m not
      listening to [Genshin Impact Lofi ✨ 1 Hour Lofi Hip
      Hop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wofB1wzyYYI&t=1193s) on YouTube, or
      something similar. Video game soundtracks are just good! I like to have
      them on in the background all the time! I also really like [this Spotify
      playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0L8SKsIJlQ4TDEJ86clycU?si=spNBbqrFS7esq16qXWBVtw) and [this
      YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8flvMNTM7NE).
