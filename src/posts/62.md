  intro:
    topic: soup
    jillian: Summer and I talk about soup a lot, like maybe an unnatural amount? We
      both just love soup very much. Itâ€™s a superior meal! I have been ordering
      the same wonton noodle soup from this place in my neighborhood on a
      near-weekly basis latelyâ€”including the day after I got my second dose of
      the vaccine, while I was laying on my couch feeling miserable all day. It
      always makes me feel better. Thereâ€™s something beyond comforting to me
      about a whole meal that is just a big bowl of warm broth with some noodles
      or whatever in it. Itâ€™s my favorite genre of food and I will always find
      solace in it, full stop. Thank you for listening.
    summer: I think I eat soup at least once a week. I really like making broth,
      handling whole spices and the way it smells is basically my substitute for
      a candle. I love the fullness that comes from eating a really big bowl of
      soup; Iâ€™ve struggled with various degrees of eating disorders a lot of my
      life and so the cheat of broth was something that helped me during really
      tough periods. I think there are a lot of foods I feel sort of repelled by
      because of the way I held them in difficult periodsâ€”soup, luckily, will
      always be good! Sometimes itâ€™s just a bowl of very good garlicy broth with
      bread ripped into it. Sometimes itâ€™s something blended and herby and also
      thereâ€™s bread, too. Sometimes itâ€™s shishbarak and itâ€™s my birthday and
      yogurt-mint-garlic is the best thing Iâ€™ve ever tasted. All soup is good
      soup and I will never accept slander!

    title01: Umang Kalraâ€™s everybodyâ€™s girlfriend
    desc01: I love zines! I bought all of the onesÂ [Umang Kalra has up on gumroad a
      month](https://gumroad.com/umangkalra)Â or so ago and finally was able to
      spend time with them; the poems inÂ *[everybodyâ€™s
      girlfriend](https://gumroad.com/umangkalra#hSTx),*Â in particular, are
      spectacularâ€”Kalra writes with a graceful bluntness. Along with the
      gorgeous collage-backdrops, these poems are super easy to get sucked
      intoâ€”if youâ€™re having trouble reading lately (I am!!!!), the
      short-but-impactful vibes are a really good solution.

    title02: Tommye Blountâ€™s What Are We Not For?
    desc02: "Me: Iâ€™m having trouble reading! Also me: recommends two books in the
      same letter! Okay, so Iâ€™ve had this really sad stack growing and growing
      on my nightstand for the past few months and was able to make the smallest
      dent in it a few days ago withÂ [this
      chapbook](https://bullcitypress.com/product/what-are-we-not-for/). Itâ€™s
      fucking gorgeous. I was literally open-mouthed the entire time; it felt
      like these poems were simply too striking toÂ *not*Â break my brain fog.
      Itâ€™s short, like chapbooks are, so that, too, can always help when youâ€™re
      in a reading slump."

    title01: Cozy Grove
    desc01: I have been trying to get back into the habit of waking up a bit earlier
      and playing video games before work, or sitting on the couch to play games
      while I eat lunch instead of sitting at my desk all desk, andÂ [Cozy
      Grove](https://cozygrovegame.com/)Â is a really good game for that. Itâ€™s a
      very sweet game with nice calming music, and Iâ€™ve really enjoyed playing
      it so far. If you like video games that are basically just fun little
      to-do lists, or if youâ€™re looking for something you can play for
      approximately 30 minutes a day (and no more! because the game will
      literally only give you so many things to do in a day, which I think is
      pretty cool!), I recommend checking it out.

    title02: Scorecard
    desc02: "This is a bit of shameless self-promo, but my company launched a new
      app this week! And Iâ€™m very proud of it! Weâ€™ve been working
      onÂ [Scorecard](https://www.getscorecard.app/)Â for a while, and itâ€™s really
      nice to see it out in the world finallyâ€”I hope people like it. Basically:
      itâ€™s an app for keeping score while you play games with your friends. Itâ€™s
      colorful and itâ€™s fun and itâ€™s easy to use. If you give it a try, please
      let me know what you think!"
