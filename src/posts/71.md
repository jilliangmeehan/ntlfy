  intro:
    topic: parasocial relationship
    jillian: I muted the word “parasocial” on Twitter this week because I’m so tired
      of hearing about it, yet here I am adding to the conversation, I guess.
      I’m working on caring less about celebrities and their lives in general.
      I’m working on not assuming I know anything about someone based on their
      online presence. I’m working on letting myself enjoy and find comfort in
      media without letting it become my entire identity—that last one’s a bit
      harder for me. I think it’s complicated and also so, so important to be
      able to feel your feelings about stuff that is being packaged up for you
      as entertainment without letting those very personal feelings bleed into
      real life, and without expecting things from people you don’t know based
      on those very personal feelings. It’s okay for you to love someone’s
      content; it’s less okay for you think that means you know anything about
      them or what kind of person they are in real life. I still struggle with
      this, sometimes! [That video of Steve from Blue’s
      Clues](https://twitter.com/nickjr/status/1435332689532440579?s=10) made me
      cry this week, even though I know I’m being pandered to! I have absolutely
      gotten too attached to celebrities and then been let down when they said
      or did something I didn’t like! But I think the more I am aware of it, the
      better I get at separating “content” and “entertainment” with real
      life—and I’m a lot happier for it.
    summer: "As a member of the Tumblr diaspora and someone who got their start in
      Disney Channel RPF YouTube, I am no stranger to the belief that I have a
      relationship to the person that lives in my screen, they are accountable
      to me, and they care about my feelings. After Chris Evans was in a Zionist
      Propaganda film, I realized the depth of how harmful the parasocial was to
      my psyche—I had been out of active fandom spaces for a few years and
      wasn’t as hyped about *celebrity* as a concept anymore, but it hurt? to
      see someone who I had devoted time to adoring do something personally and
      structurally harmful to me? What’s more interesting is the way that
      parasocial relationships alter who we stick up for: what do we tolerate,
      and from who? I’m definitely guilty of hyper intellectualizing my
      interests, trying to find meaning for what I love outside of the fact that
      it’s “fun” (because we’re not allowed to have fun or experience pleasure
      for the sake of it, of course) and parasocial relationships are
      instrumental in that intellectualizing—to theorize about the politics of
      celebrity or pseudo-public figures like content creators means to believe
      you have access to their interiority, something we really don’t! Do we
      even have access to the interiority of all of the people we call friends?
      Sometimes no! I’ve had a lot less “your fave is problematic” heartbreaks
      over the years. I quite simply felt nothing upon the cancellation of Lea
      Michele, something that would have devastated me at fourteen—instead, it’s
      information I absorb, I move on, I listen to another Broadway-adjacent
      woman in my free time and stop pretending any of her albums post-Glee were
      good. Detachment! It’s good. Never meet your heroes nor defend them on the
      internet."

    title01: You Are Not Dead by Wendy Xu
    desc01: My friend dropped off a stack of books for me to read during the Sealey
      Challenge that I did not, in fact, read, but my September has been off to
      a great start in terms of finishing books. My favorite thus far has
      been *You Are Not Dead* by Wendy Xu; a series of kind of
      quirky-but-in-a-successful-way poems that felt very pertinent to my
      current Big Depressive Mood. [Buy it

    desc02: "[This is such a fun new
      feature](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-31/how-spotifys-newest-pers\
      onalized-experience-blend-creates-a-playlist-for-you-and-your-bestie/)!
      I’ve been sending friends invite links to blend our music tastes (many of
      us listen to Mitski) and building the best playlists full of tracks I
      already listen to with a little bit of new stuff sprinkled around in
      there. Just search “Blend” in your Spotify search and it’ll take you to
      where to generate them."

    title01: Pinterest
    desc01: I know this is a silly recommendation
      because [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) is already a very popular
      app and lots of people have been using it for years. But this is my
      newsletter so I can do what I want. I went through a short-lived Pinterest
      phase in college when I wanted to be a lifestyle blogger or something
      (lol). And now I’m back at it! I’ve been making due with other social
      media apps to find specific vibes that I’m looking for, but Pinterest
      really is it—I love being able to search for the exact kind of inspiration
      I’m looking for, whether it’s an outfit, a tattoo, a hairstyle, or a
      really cute desk setup. Plus, it makes me feel like I’m back in my super
      early Tumblr days, curating my taste with reblogs.

    title02: Chill with Taiki
    desc02: "[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfW86fnQL5w) is one of my
      favorite livestreams to listen to, whether I’m trying to get work done or
      I’m just laying on the couch drinking tea. Perfect for chill, cozy vibes.
      I also like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgD5A2v3cp0), which
      has a pomodoro timer to help you stay focused."
