  intro:
    topic: self care
    jillian: Not to be dramatic but sometimes existing in this world is hard. Like,
      the idea of getting out of bed and sitting at my desk for several hours a
      day, or cooking a meal for myself and then washing all the dishes, or even
      just taking a shower and washing my face—sometimes it’s just too much.
      Sometimes it feels like the best I can do is lay on the couch in
      yesterday’s t-shirt and eat a bowl of cereal and play video games. And
      that’s cool! I am trying to be a lot more forgiving with myself on those
      days. But I am also trying to take better care of myself, to at least do
      the bare minimum. Yes, sure, sheet masks and bubble baths are self care.
      But so is brushing your teeth and taking a big gulp of water on the hard
      days. So is cleaning off a tiny area of your desk so you feel a little
      less stressed while you’re working. (And so is knowing when to stop
      pushing yourself and just lay down on the couch for a little bit.)
    summer: "For a while I thought I “wasn’t into skincare,” because so much of what
      I saw online was about glamorous ritual and this indulgence into
      complicated process. It was also largely focused on the face. As
      conversations around the capitalism-poisoned term “self care” grew more
      prevalent in the spaces I frequented, I realized of course, I was “into
      skincare”—because I have to be! I have eczema! In fact, I am deeply into
      taking care and managing the health of my skin, otherwise I’m covered in
      cuts from dry skin cracking! It took literally re-arranging the
      phrase—instead of self care, it’s *taking care of yourself—*for me to
      realize self care isn’t a trendy thing I’m behind on. Allowing this to be
      an act instead of a concept helped me think about the things I actually
      need to do in order to regulate my health, thinking about how to
      continually fold them into my routine: drinking water, sleeping early,
      flossing—normal things that are very hard when you’re depressed. The
      extra, the sometimes superfluous—an extra special meal, staying in bed
      longer than normal—these things can be folded into taking care of myself,
      too, but I can’t ignore the basics."

    title01: Soft scrambled eggs
    desc01: I never liked eggs growing up. My parents would try a myriad of ways of
      trying to get me to eat them since they’re “good for you,” but I refused
      unless very specific circumstances were met (I wanted to play video games
      with my brother while eating). When I started college, eggs were an easy
      source of protein and very easy to bulk up sad leftovers—you know when
      there’s like, half a serving left of basically any meal? Add an egg! It’s
      great. But my favorite way to eat them are creamy, soft-scrambled on
      really crusty bread, spinach, and some soft cheese spread—season with
      salt, pepper, and chili flakes. I had this for breakfast the other day and
      just remembered, yes! This is the best thing!

    title02: Samia’s The Baby
    desc02: I first heard Samia in 2018 or 2019 when she had just a handful of songs
      on Spotify; she came up on some indie sad girl playlist and I loved the
      absolute crazy intensity of her voice, but she wasn’t on my regular
      rotation until 2020. Her semi-recently released *[The
      Baby](https://open.spotify.com/album/7faAwJDTt9Y8kVAcSHy9Y6),* along with
      the cover-album *[The Baby
      Reimagined](https://open.spotify.com/album/7MGuErisn7eWnGriy2iGbZ)* are
      equally excellent and a very good, vibe-y time.

    title01: Homemade iced chai
    desc01: I love iced chais—the venti ones at Starbucks singlehandedly got me
      through college. Now, though, they’re a pretty rare treat for me since I
      don’t go to coffee shops all that often. But! Last week I picked up a
      container of [Tazo’s chai
      concentrate](https://www.tazo.com/us/en/products/lattes-iced/classic-chai-latte.html) at
      the grocery store and used it to make a pretty yummy iced chai with oat
      milk at home. I think it’s going to be my new Friday morning treat.

    title02: Dram
    desc02: Another beverage! I tried this [“herbal sparkling
      water”](https://www.dramapothecary.com/) on a whim the other day and liked
      it a lot—I got the cardamom & black tea flavor, which is a pretty weird
      (but delicious) flavor for sparkling water. Turns out they have some other
      cool-sounding flavors, plus a CBD version, which I really want to try.
