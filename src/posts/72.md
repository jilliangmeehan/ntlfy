  intro:
    topic: painting
    jillian: I have a hard time doing hobbies just for me, just for fun, without the
      expectation of improving or showing anyone or doing anything with it. It’s
      something I’m trying to work on. At the beginning of the year, I decided I
      wanted to get into watercolor painting—I bought supplies, I was looking
      for online courses to take and YouTube tutorials to learn from, and I had
      ambitions to make little paintings I could mail to my friends across the
      country and hang up in my apartment. I didn’t end up taking any courses,
      and I have yet to paint anything for a friend, but I do still get out my
      watercolor set every once in a while and paint something simple, no
      direction or goals in mind. Sometimes it turns out well and I hang the
      painting up above my desk. Sometimes I’m less happy with the outcome and I
      stash it away somewhere and forget about it. Either way, the time I spend
      painting makes me feel good. Part of me still wants to learn and improve,
      but part of me is content with being sort of mediocre and enjoying myself
      anyway. I think—hear me out—it’s good to not always be good at stuff. It’s
      enough to just do it.
    summer: During Pandemic Part I (pre-vaccine era), my friend Ben started posting
      these really gorgeous watercolors she was making. Like Jill, she was
      following YouTube tutorials to churn out just, the loveliest paintings I
      had seen someone who was just painting casually do. I asked her for advice
      on materials and she sent me a palette and brushes and paper in the mail!
      I started sitting outside and painting in the sun, encouraging myself to
      get 40 minutes of Vitamin D a day while doing an activity that didn’t
      involve screens. I had my DeviantArt phase in middle school and was really
      into drawing and digital art but never really had the patience to let
      myself improve; it’s been so nice to just *enjoy* painting, with no
      expectation for myself on how it needs to turn out, only showing what I do
      to my friends. I like to paint Pokemon and food and keep everything in a
      little box.

    title01: Hoa
    desc01: I’m normally not a fan of platformers since I feel like video games have
      Advanced Past That (don’t bully me) but when I saw the trailer for this
      game, I instantly fell in love with the music and character design. I’m
      not super far through yet, but every time I’ve played I’ve felt sooooo
      serene. You can buy it
      on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1484900/Hoa/) or
      the [Nintendo eShop for
      Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hoa-switch/).

    title02: MONTERO
    desc02: The long-anticipated [Lil Nas X
      album](https://open.spotify.com/album/6pOiDiuDQqrmo5DbG0ZubR?si=d5e85d0b280d4fcb) is
      here and I have listened to it every day, multiple times, since it
      dropped. It’s truly incredible. The features are so good and it has such a
      cohesive, narrative feel to it, I love to have fun and cry a little bit
      too.

    title01: star-crossed
    desc01: I’ve been waiting for [Kacey Musgraves’ divorce
      album](https://open.spotify.com/album/6y9LbrjY2TpaLvtbE7FTkc?si=ad36a90e3db74ff4) to
      come out for so long and now it’s *here* and it’s wonderful and I love it.
      It’s gonna be on repeat for the rest of the year, I can tell. My favorite
      song is [cherry
      blossom](https://open.spotify.com/track/3PT3dmokgfqJSsZxv4Njw5?si=fc50f9b043bd41d0),
      but there are really no skips for me.

    title02: Promare
    desc02: "[This movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9116358/) was recently
      rereleased in theaters, which means I just watched it three times in one
      weekend (twice in a theater, and once really tiny on my phone in a tent
      while camping). I will probably never get tired of watching it—it just
      gets better and more fun every time. Watch it for: colors! shapes! music!
      firefighters! himbo energy! and just a generally very good time."
