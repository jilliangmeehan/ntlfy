  intro:
    topic: quarantine
    jillian: "I told Summer there were two directions we could go in this week: we
      could write about quarantine, or we could write about something else. We
      both agreed it felt wrong to choose the latter, at least right now. So
      we’re writing about it—it’s just that writing about it is hard. Maybe
      because it’s no longer new; it’s been 39 days, for me, of feeling anxious
      every time I go outside for groceries, wearing a mask and gloves and
      staying as far away from other people as I can. Part of me is worried I’ll
      forget what it feels like to go outside without thinking about it—or that
      I’ll never be able to again. I am making peace with it, but that doesn’t
      always mean I feel good. Some days are okay, and other days I carry the
      heavy weight of anxiety around in my chest no matter what I do. There’s no
      way to put it lightly: this sucks. I am trying to take it one day at a
      time, and to look for small moments of joy: the sound of rain outside
      through an open window while I sleep, dancing in my kitchen while I make
      dinner, the way the sun hits my bedroom wall just right in the afternoon,
      underlining a line in a book that makes me feel good. (Also: I am still
      revisiting our [last newsletter](https://letterstosummer.com/35) for
      suggestions of ways to feel better right now—maybe that’s something you
      need, too.)"
    summer: Quarantine is really the only angle I can think about things, which I’m
      sure many people can relate to. I’m still working, from home, trying to
      keep normal business hours. I wake up, drink coffee with my boyfriend,
      check my turnip prices, and check my e-mail. I’ve broken the “no working
      in bed” rule many times these past weeks—it’s the most comfortable place
      to be. Every workplace annoyance feels worse, every headache or stomach
      pain the end of the world. I dropped half a banana today and almost cried.
      I’ve always been dramatic, quick to jump to the worst conclusions, ruled
      by anxiety, but some of it doesn’t feel as irrational now. We are making
      do; I’m lucky I’m with people I love, and I have others to reach out to
      often. Every time I am outside I am grateful in a way I wasn’t before,
      too. Picking produce at the grocery store a few weeks ago felt like a
      deeply precious thing and I love the taste of everything fresh, so much.
      It’s weird, it’s fucking weird, it’s tragic, and don’t let anyone make you
      feel weird for thinking it is.

    title01: Clue (1985)
    desc01: Whodunnits are just the best! I’d be wanting to see this movie for quite
      a bit, but it’s finally streaming on Prime Video and Kanopy. This movie is
      based off of the boardgame, Clue, which may not be a big selling point,
      but listen. It’s perfect! It’s perfect. It’s so fucking hilarious,
      everyone in the cast is a gem, it uses its source material very
      creatively, campy as hell, and has the best last line of any film in
      history. Nothing is better! Please go have fun!

    title02: Birthright by George Abraham
    desc02: "[George’s work](https://letterstosummer.com/3) has been among
      the [batches](https://letterstosummer.com/27) of [poems](https://letterst\
      osummer.com/12) I’ve recommended before, but their full length debut is
      finally here—*Birthright!* It is a stunning, heart-wrenching, brilliant
      collection that I am so, so happy to finally hold in my hands. George is
      an absolute mastermind with form. They know how to communicate intensely
      and intricately, and there’s nothing more I want to do than spend hours
      and hours and hours with their work. You can buy it from [Button
      Poetry](https://buttonpoetry.com/product/birthright/) (make sure to check
      out the blurb I co-wrote with other friends, hehe)."

    title01: Collaborative playlists
    desc01: This week, my friend [Cassie](http://twitter.com/cassiebirb) asked a few
      of us to pick ten songs each to put on a collaborative playlist that we
      could all listen to. Picking just ten songs was surprisingly difficult,
      but it was fun to come up with a mix of songs that I’ve liked for a while
      and newer songs that I’ve been listening to a lot lately—and I loved
      seeing what my friends added. I won’t share our playlist, because I like
      that it’s just for us, but I do recommend making collaborative playlists
      as a really cute way to connect with people.

      Rpb24ifQ.yxQArScDu1nUUbm-sAxSwyKKYrQ50x8KWc2_2vok3NM) is one of my
      favorite newsletters right now. It started as a series
      of [tweets](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=hedhouseman%3A%20%22mor\
      ning%20report%22) from [Haley
      Houseman](http://twitter.com/hedhouseman) about things she saw on
      early-morning walks with her dog, and is now a beautiful, occasional
      newsletter that is mostly about nature but is sometimes about other
      things, too. The most recent one, titled [“Potential
      hauntings,”](https://hedhouseman.substack.com/p/potential-hauntings?token\

      all kinds of things, but I suggest you read [this
      one](https://hedhouseman.substack.com/p/what-is-the-morning-report) to
      start with."
