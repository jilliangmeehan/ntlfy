  intro:
    topic: "50"
    jillian: This is our 50th letter, which is weird and hard to believe but
      also…not. It’s been so long since we started this (almost two years!) that
      I can’t really remember a time when we weren’t writing this newsletter
      together every two weeks, honestly. It’s a comforting, familiar part of my
      routine now—and it’s one of my favorite things to work on. I’m glad I get
      to make something cool and fun that I’m proud of with one of my best
      friends on a regular basis. I love seeing the way it’s evolved over time.
      And I love that no matter what else is happening in our lives, this
      newsletter will be a solid constant, every other Thursday, right on
      schedule (usually). In this letter, we’re gonna recommend a few things
      that have helped us make Letters to Summer happen. Thanks for being here
      with us.
    summer: As I’ve written dozens of times in this newsletter, I’m bad at habits,
      I’m bad at routine. The constant in my life, for the past two years,
      really has been this newsletter. The fact that it lasted through major
      transitions in my life is honestly 100% thanks to Jill—as you’ll see by
      the rest of the letter, the bulk of the technical work is on her. She
      hosts our website, she formats the letter; I “run” the “Patreon” and
      “contribute ideas to the on x topic each week,” but she is my tech queen
      Virgo rising best friend and I love doing this with her! We are so happy
      to have all of you with us, too.

    title01: Letterboxd
    desc01: I have a bad memory and I forget what I’ve consumed the second I’ve done
      so; using Letterboxd has helped me, both find movies to watch and remember
      that I watched them. I’m averse to recording my media intake with my own
      personal systems, because brain bad, but I love the mostly cataloging
      social platforms that help me keep track instead. On a week where I have
      no idea what to recommend, I just look at what I’ve logged on Letterbox,
      and realize that I do, in fact, consume new content! It doesn’t have the
      corporate brainworms the way Goodreads does, so logging a lower-rating on
      a movie doesn’t feel like I’m ruining someone’s life. [You can follow me
      there](https://letterboxd.com/summabis/), if you’d like!

    title02: The recommendation process
    desc02: "I’ve definitely recommended shows on major TV Networks and Marvel
      films, but every other week I basically ask myself: what have I consumed
      that could benefit from me saying I have done so? Even if just one person
      picks up this book, how can I use my word the most? I don’t want to
      recommend Captain Marvel before a chapbook from a small press. The further
      we get into this letter, the more mindful I am of the things I endorse. I
      think back to an early, early letter in which I talked about my devotion
      to Claire Saffitz; now, the entirety of BA leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
      In reality, she never needed me, and the brand didn’t, either. There’s no
      such thing as pure consumption, and our letter still exists under
      capitalism, but there are always things we can do. I don’t want to
      recommend Amazon Prime shows anymore or send you there to buy a book. I
      don’t want to give views to people who probably hate me. I don’t regret
      what I’ve recommended in the past, because I know in the moment they
      brought me joy and I just wanted others to feel it, too. But the fact that
      people *listen to me* is just a blessing, so if there are tiny tiny ways I
      can make the world better? As long as people are listening, I will try."

    title01: Notion
    desc01: "I’ve mentioned [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) in this
      newsletter [before](https://letterstosummer.com/24), but I’m bringing it
      up again because it’s played a big part in writing and keeping track of
      our letter drafts. So, for the Notion fanatics, I wanted to share a little
      bit about our setup: Summer and I have a shared Notion board with all of
      our drafts, separated into categories—main letters, plus the three
      different kinds of bonus letters we write for Patreon subscribers. Each
      draft has a status (“Not started,” “Drafted,” or “Published”) so we can
      easily see what’s going on; and a due date, so we can also look at them on
      a calendar view to see which letters are coming up next. Plus, we have
      templates for each type of letter we write, so all we have to do when we
      write a new draft is fill in what we need."

    title02: Ulysses
    desc02: "There are a million text editors and word processors I could use to
      write my recommendations for this newsletter, but my go-to most of the
      time is [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/). Here’s why: I like writing
      in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and I like having a lot of
      control over my writing space. My favorite thing about Ulysses is its
      customizability—from the font, to the line height and width, to the custom
      themes. You can browse for themes on the [Ulysses
      website](https://styles.ulysses.app/themes), or you can create your own
      using any colors and text styles you like. Writing in Ulysses is just
      pleasant and I like it a lot! Give it a try if you’re comfortable with
      Markdown and want to use a nice, pretty text editor for writing."
