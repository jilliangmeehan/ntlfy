  intro:
    topic: Lorde
    jillian: The first time I listened to *Melodrama*, I was in the living room of
      my college apartment sitting on the couch with a friend who was sharing my
      bedroom for the summer—we squeezed so many people into that three-bedroom
      apartment, partners and exes and friends and crushes coming and going
      during the two years we lived there—and I remember having an immediate
      attachment to it the way I never really had with *Pure Heroine*. Listening
      to The Louvre and Writer In The Dark and Supercut and Perfect Places for
      the first time, sitting in a room bathed in pink light, surrounded by
      friends in the first place that really felt like home to me since I
      left *home—*I’ll probably never forget that. I’ll also probably never
      forget listening to those songs alone in the car at night, windows down,
      driving around my hometown just to do it, just because I needed to.
    summer: I was not going through a breakup when *Melodrama* came out. I remember
      listening to it clearly; I was in my bedroom, the lights were off, and I
      still used Snapchat. Everything in that album felt visceral—I was, quite
      literally, a *writer in the dark;* even if my experiences were not aligned
      with Lorde at that moment, I felt like our emotional vibes were on the
      same track. As I revisit *Pure Heroine*, it feels more like
      a *forever* album than I had originally expected—there is always some part
      of me that will be longing for that sense of surrealness in coming-of-age,
      coupled with a hazy awareness that things will change, and no moment can
      ever be perfectly replicated; all we have are our memories, and that
      album. As I move into “adulthood” during a global pandemic, I’ve been
      listening to a lot of Lorde—partly in anticipation, partly because I want
      to imagine that surreal aliveness again, instead of the dulled movements
      15 months in my house have produced. I’m not sure if I’m ready for what
      I’m predicting her next era will be, based off of “Solar Power”. I think,
      though, I want to be someone that not only longs for the sun, but goes to
      it.

    title01: We Are Lady Parts
    desc01: This show, available
      on [Peacock](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiZiJHvxJ_xAhXiVTABHSFfBT8QFjAAegQIBRAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peacocktv.com%2Fstream-tv%2Fwe-are-lady-parts&usg=AOvVaw0B0SOweTCqlzu3QRtcrEuv),
      is about a Muslim girl punk band and guess what!!!! It is as cool and fun
      as that description sounds!!! I watched all six episodes in a
      depression-haze and it helped me into a peaceful sleep. It made me cry! It
      made me scream (quietly, because it was 2AM)! As well as providing great
      camp and bright colors, the short arc of the season gives a generally
      balanced amount of time to each character while having a clear protagonist
      who carries us through. I love women!!! I need a second season,
      desperately, so you all have to watch it even if that means making a
      Peacock account!!!!

    title02: Watermelon with feta cheese
    desc02: It’s hot outside!!!! It’s watermelon season!!!! Go get a watermelon and
      cut it up and put it in the fridge until it’s very very cold and top it
      with your favorite salty cheese, it doesn’t have to be feta. This is my
      favorite meal when I am combatting my constant dehydration.

    title01: LILAC
    desc01: "[This](https://open.spotify.com/album/01dPJcwyht77brL4JQiR8R) is the
      album that will get me through this summer!!! I sent it to Summer a few
      weeks ago and said “i think u would like this album” and she told me she
      was vibing to it so hard while writing to-do lists, which is such high
      praise, and exactly the same energy that it gives me. Vibing while I write
      to-do lists, vibing while I carry a 20lb bag of cat litter home, vibing
      while I walk to the train to go to work."

    title02: 2021 Wholesome Games Direct
    desc02: As much fun as watching the Nintendo Direct and the rest of E3 is every
      year, the [Wholesome Games
      direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozqhc7YXd3M) is really what I look
      forward to the most—it’s a roundup of a bunch of cute indie games (and
      when I say “a bunch,” I mean it. I think this year they had about 75
      games.) that are available across many platforms. Some of the games I’m
      most looking forward to from this year’s direct
      are [Venba](https://venbagame.com/), [Snacko](https://snacko.land/), [Soup
      Pot](https://chikon.club/), [Garden
      Story](https://gardenstorygame.com/), [Yokai
