  intro:
    topic: holidays
    jillian: This is my first year not going home for Thanksgiving, and may also be
      the first year I don’t go home for Christmas. And it’s weird! I miss my
      family, and I will deeply miss the ritual of getting out of the city and
      going to the house I grew up in, eating dinner with my family, seeing my
      parents’ dog, feeling warm. This year, I guess, I’ll find new rituals—I’ll
      walk through Brooklyn to my boyfriend’s apartment to make dinner with him
      and his roommates, I’ll Facetime my parents, I’ll watch the movies my mom
      and I watch every year alone. I won’t get to help my parents decorate the
      house for the holidays, but I can get decorations for my own apartment. I
      won’t get that cozy feeling of being *home for the holidays,* but I can
      light some candles and burrow under a blanket and put a virtual fireplace
      on my TV and do my best to pretend.
    summer: Holidays are always a little weird in my house. I am an impatient person
      and think that trait features itself most prominently in my family’s
      celebration—if we are able to have something now, why wait? We open
      Christmas gifts ridiculously early, asking each other exactly what the
      other wants so there are no surprises; Thanksgiving is a weird holiday to
      celebrate in general, especially as Palestinians; Easter has one ritual
      that I love, but we’re Orthodox Christians and celebrate it a month later
      than the rest of the US—our timing always feels off, and so we make our
      own. Maamoul and ‘atayif are traditionally sweets served at the holidays,
      but we make it when we want. This morning, I had berbara, which is barley
      or wheat-berry with basically oatmeal fixings, meant to honor either Saint
      Barbara or a child’s new tooth—the holiday is not until December and I do
      not know any toddlers. Watching people navigate their families in the
      pandemic makes me feel this anxiety of timing more clearly—the urgency to
      gather, because we feel like we are supposed to. The urgency to feel
      holiday cheer, because we feel like we are supposed to. In a normal year,
      there are so many factors complicating that; in a year like this, how is
      it remotely possible?

    title01: More cute masks
    desc01: A few months back, [Jill recommended a spot to buy
      masks](https://letterstosummer.com/42); I’ve got a few more! The ones that
      have worked best for me so far are
      from [Baggu](https://baggu.com/collections/reusable-masks), with the
      adjustable ear-loops. Jill and I split a pack of [these daisy
      ones](https://baggu.com/collections/reusable-masks/products/fabric-mask-set-loop-daisy-1).
      Super comfortable, don’t make my glasses fog, incredible secure and easy
      to wash! I also got a bunch from [this account on
      Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yeahleanora/), they’re all beautiful
      and have a pouch for a filter. Despite popular belief, the pandemic is
      ongoing and horrible, make sure you’re taking care of yourselves and not
      endangering loved ones.

    title02: Making salted caramel
    desc02: For some reason, couldn’t imagine why, I’ve been feeling down and sad
      and only really want to consume sugary things. I made a pumpkin pie
      recently and wanted to make it a little more interesting, so I folded in
      salted caramel to the filling. It was SO good. And the next week, after
      the pie was gone, I made caramel again to add to Ghiradelli brownies. Just
      for fun! Making caramel (maybe it’s actually butterscotch, shhh) is
      incredible easy, surprisingly—I used [this
      recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-salted-caramel-recipe/).
      I used normal butter instead of salted, and added 2-3 tsps of ground
      Himalayan salt to compensate. What a wonderful little joy.

    title01: SimplyE
    desc01: When I was a kid, I used to love going to the library. I would sit on
      the ground and flip through books and decide which to add to the huge
      stack I wanted to take home with me to read. In school, the library was
      one of my favorite places to be—I remember accidentally missing the start
      of classes more than once because I was so engrossed in a book. As an
      adult, I don’t go to libraries very often. But I’m rediscovering my love
      for them (in a COVID-safe way, lol) with the [NYPL SimplyE
      app](https://www.nypl.org/books-music-movies/ebookcentral/simplye). If
      you’re in NYC, you can use SimplyE to check out and read e-books from one
      of the local libraries, even if you don’t have a library card.

    title02: Indie bookstores
    desc02: This is an evergreen recommendation, but with the holidays coming up I
      wanted to call special attention to it. A lot of small businesses are
      struggling this year, and buying holiday gifts from them instead of huge,
      exploitative retailers (Amazon, I’m talking about Amazon) is a really good
      way to help them stay afloat. Indie bookstores are especially good sources
      for gifts, in my opinion, and a few of my favorite local ones are [McNally
      Jackson](https://www.mcnallyjackson.com/) and [Books Are
      Magic](https://booksaremagic.net/). If you’re not in NYC, give your own
      local indies some love or order
      from [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/) or [Bookshop](https://bookshop.org/).
