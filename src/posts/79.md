  intro:
    topic: cardigans
    jillian: I often refer to Summer as the queen of cardigans, because she has
      great cardigans and she wears them very well and always looks so cozy and
      cool in them. I’ve spent, like, years wanting to emulate her cardigan
      vibes. I finally got my dream cardigan—navy, slightly oversized, huge
      buttons—and I’ve been living in it, feeling like Summer.
    summer: I think if I was a cartoon character, my base outfit would be this one
      cardigan that I have—it’s beige, black, and grey color blocks and is
      so *fun* in such a subdued way. I’m someone who, when I wear color, people
      remark on it. I’m trying to incorporate things besides black and grey into
      my wardrobe these days, and found that outerwear was actually the most
      comfortable way to do it; I took a bright yellow jacket from my mom that a
      friend lovingly called my “Freddie Mercury jacket”; she’d been trying to
      give it to me for years and I never felt ready until after nearly two
      years inside with very little reason for outerwear. It’s cold in my
      apartment and so I wear cardigans during every work day; I alternate
      between the multicolor one and this orange-red-ish one that many a
      coworker had privately messaged me to ask about. For Christmas, I got a
      mostly-pink knit that I haven’t wanted to take off since. It feels like
      such a cheat, in a way, to be noticed by something that envelops my body;
      I am seen without being seen, complimented without the discomfort of
      having to contend with *having a physical form* (which, as someone with
      body dysmorphia, is kind of fucked up!). I love to be cozy and warm and
      kind of feel automatically stylish with something oversized and pretty,
      still getting to stick to a black-shirt-and-black-linen-pants combo
      underneath. I can wear any earrings with a big cardigan. I can make it
      fancy, make it smart, wear it on a bad day. My signature.

    title01: The Witcher TV Series
    desc01: I asked Jill, is it ridiculous to recommend two *Witcher* related
      things? And she said no, it’s cool, it gives you an opportunity to talk
      about why you like them both. And so here I am! In December, I finally
      watched the first season of *The Witcher* on Netflix with my roommate.
      It’d been on my radar since its release in 2019 but I hadn’t been in the
      right mindset. Luckily, this time around it activated that obsessive part
      of my brain that turned rabid when I was 12 years old and first exposed
      to *Glee*. Perhaps my love of BBC Merlin is well documented, and my
      distaste of GOT’s saturated sexual violence is, too; *Witcher* has a great
      balance of FUN!!!!!!! with a mysterious/serious-ish plot. I Henry Cavill!
      What a beautiful man! It’s a fun show about found family and
      colonialism(?) with an undercurrent of Polish mythology. So good! Watch
      seasons 1 and 2
      on [Netflix](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=the+witcher+netflix&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).

    title02: Witcher 3
    desc02: "And now onto [the video game](https://thewitcher.com/en)! Notoriously,
      media adapted from video games is NOT GOOD, but watching *The Witcher* and
      seeing the little quirks that were definitely game mechanics made me want
      to PLAY even though it really isn’t my ~type of game (read: not Nintendo
      or indie). But! It is SO FUN. It’s gigantic and immersive and the
      morality/choice mechanics are incredibly compelling (and stressful). I
      really like playing so firmly as Dad Geralt. The game takes place far out
      from where the show is, so it’s cool to see the characters I know from one
      medium far more developed and also *different* in this other one. Nothing
      better when spending a global pandemic as a bitter-insane-asthmatic than
      escaping into the life of gigantic, terrifying man who is also terribly
      soft."

    title01: Get Back
    desc01: It’s a little embarrassing to admit to going through a Beatles phase in
      2022, but it is real and it is happening to me. I wish there were about 30
      more hours of footage in [Get
      Back](https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/series/the-beatles-get-back/7DcWEeWVqrkE),
      the new Peter Jackson Beatles documentary on Disney+, but I’ll settle for
      the wonderful 9ish hours that we got. I don’t think you necessarily need
      to be a Beatles fan to enjoy this—I found it really calming, comforting,
      and interesting just to get to watch some dudes hang out and write music.

    title02: Lava lamps
    desc02: My boyfriend gave me a lava lamp for Christmas and I love it so much!!!!
      It’s so nice to look at, to get up and turn on in the morning, to have in
      the background of work meetings, etc. He picked a blue one with white lava
      because he said it reminded him of clouds, which makes me very happy. If
      you don’t have a lava lamp, I promise they are very fun to literally just
      sit and look at. Vibes!!!!!
