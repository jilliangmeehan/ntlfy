  intro:
    jillian: We’re a couple of months into the year—how are you doing? I feel calmer
      and more comfortable than I ever have in my life and yet I’m still taking
      on way too many projects and trying to work on 726482 things at once! I’m
      a mess. It’s fine.
    summer: Hello friends! I turned in the first chunk of my thesis last week so I
      am feeling exhausted and hopeful. Rami Malek has an Oscar, so I’m happy
      about that! I have a poem in the [newest issue of
      Mizna](https://squareup.com/store/mizna/item/mizna-the-palestine-issue),
      which is literally a dream come true. Please check it out!

    title01: Sex Education
    desc01: I always feel silly recommending things that lots of people already know
      are good, but you know what? Sometimes people just have good taste! Asa
      Butterfield is so good! He’s been in so many notable roles before this but
      honestly, he will always be a tiny, mostly silent druid boy. BBC’s Merlin
      will haunt me forever. He’s almost good enough in Sex Education that I
      forget about that, though. Gillian Anderson is also just so beautiful and
      fun to watch. Every side character is delightful. You can watch it
      on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80197526)!

    title02: What If
    desc02: This is a romantic comedy starring Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan from
      2013 that I used to absolutely love. I watched it for the first time in
      probably four years and it holds up! My nostalgia spirals have been so
      excellent (painful) that I’ve returned to Tumblr—I was going through my
      Daniel Radcliffe tag and seeing so many quotes from the press tour and,
      reader, they were cringe-y as hell. Every conversation was about the
      friendzone and (thankfully) how it doesn’t exist, etc., but it’s like,
      okay we get it! We get what the movie is about! But the movie itself isn’t
      as heavy-handed. It’s fun and everyone has that copy-cat witty voice that
      makes you laugh no matter whose mouth the dialogue is coming out of.
      Daniel Radcliffe is ridiculously charming even though he looks like shit
      the whole film (he is capable of better!!!!!!!!!!!!!). Zoe Kazan is an
      angel lead. I love that 16 year-old-me wasn’t just blinded by Harry Potter
      in her love for this movie. You can watch it on [Amazon
      Prime](https://www.amazon.com/What-If-Daniel-Radcliffe/dp/B00PSO1NFE)!
      You’re welcome, Bezos!

    title01: Calm
    desc01: This is actually a secondhand
      recommendation—I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1091705300367880192) a
      few weeks ago asking what meditation apps people use and like,
      and [Kara](https://twitter.com/karahaupt?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) was
      the only person who told me to
      use [Calm](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm.com/id571800810). I’ve
      been using it ever since! My new hobby is getting away from my desk every
      day at 5 p.m. for 10 minutes of meditation.

    title02: No-knead bread
    desc02: "Three facts about me: I am notoriously lazy, I am bad in the kitchen,
      and I love bread. No-knead bread is the perfect recipe for someone like
      me, because it requires almost no effort for the truly incredible payoff
      of having fresh, warm, homemade bread. I’ve used [this
      recipe](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-noknead-bread-home-109343) a
      few times and it has never let me down."
