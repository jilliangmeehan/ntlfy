  intro:
    jillian: Iâ€™m sorry, but Iâ€™m making the executive decision that we get to stop
      naming these newsletters. Numbers only from now on! Naming things is too
      hard! Anyway, lately Iâ€™ve been working
      onÂ [SNAX](https://snaxreport.com/)Â again after a long hiatus, which feels
      really good. Not to be thirsty, but
      followÂ [@snaxreport](https://instagram.com/snaxreport)Â on Instagram if you
      love me.
    summer: "I AM IN HOUSTON! This week I am competing in my first CUPSI (and last,
      farewell college). In other poems news: I have two pieces in the newest
      issue ofÂ [FlyPaper Magazine](https://flypapermagazine.com/issue10/)â€”take a
      look ðŸ˜Ž"

    title01: Polygonâ€™s Unraveled
    desc01: I love video games & I love video game lore & I love ridiculously deep
      looks into things not often deemed valuable enough to thinkÂ *that much
      about*. Brian David Gilbert is fucking hilarious and absolutely endearing.
      Iâ€™ve found myself in many bad places the past few months and watching
      these videos has never not made me smile;Â [start with one that goes into a
      game youâ€™ve
      played](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDrN74SfdT7Ueqtwn_bXo1MuSWT0ji2w)!

    title02: closegood
    desc02: closegood is a trip hop duo composed of two members, Nyfe and Amada.
      They recently came out with an album,Â *GRAVEN*. Their lyrics are fucking
      amazing and everything is so well-produced. Stream them
      onÂ [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5WMqDLP9BqcRvsuV8hibMP?si=HQNyASQCRUeqv3qRVjwtpw)!

    title01: The Pattern
    desc01: Look, I love Co-Star as much as the next person.
      ButÂ [Laura](https://laustrology.com/)Â told me about another app,Â [The
      Pattern](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-pattern/id1071085727?mt=8),
      that uses your birth chart to lovingly drag every aspect of your life and
      your relationships and itâ€™s really next-level. Also, thereâ€™s no mention of
      any planets or zodiac signs in the whole appâ€”so if you want horoscopes
      that donâ€™t feel like horoscopes, youâ€™ll love it. (P.S. add me as a
      friend!)

    title02: Pop Up Grocer
    desc02: If youâ€™re in NYC and love snacks, you have to go.Â [Pop Up
      Grocer](https://www.popupgrocer.co/)Â opened last weekend and is full of
      tons of yummy snacks and drinksâ€”plus cute merch and food-related zines.
      Basically my paradise.
