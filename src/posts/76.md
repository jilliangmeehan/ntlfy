  intro:
    topic: stress
    jillian: I think there is a particular kind of stress that you don’t really
      notice until you’re surrounded by it—less like plunging into cold water
      and more like sitting in a bath for hours and hours while it gradually
      gets colder, until you’re shivering. This is the kind of stress I feel
      when I’m in the middle of a task, working at my desk for a couple of hours
      past when I should be, because all I can think about is finishing. As soon
      as I finish what I’m doing, the stress settles into my body in the worst
      way. On a small scale, it just means I need to spend the evening laying on
      my couch doing absolutely nothing until I feel better. On a large scale,
      over time, it leads to burnout. I’m always working on….not doing that.
      Always working on setting boundaries, checking in with myself, etc. etc.
      Sometimes stress is pretty unavoidable, but sometimes all I need to do is
      take a second to be like, am I feeling okay right now? Do I need a break?
      Do I need to cuddle my cat right now instead of doing whatever I’m doing?
      (Probably yes.)
    summer: "Sometimes choosing these letter topics is like looking around a room
      and combining objects together to make a fake name, panicked while I’m on
      the phone with someone I shouldn’t be. Jill asks, what should we write
      about? and I think: how am I feeling, what have I been doing, am I super
      into anything lately—and today, the running theme is: stress! Stress goes
      hand-in-hand with my anxiety, aggravated by my depression, the vicious
      cycle of mental-illness-and-overwhelm. There’s nothing
      particularly *happening* right now, except for the pandemic I guess, but
      it’s been really hard to feel like I have enough time the past few weeks.
      I’ve been trying to *wake up* and just *go,* but then I’m worried I’m not
      having enough fun and I’m young so I deserve to, and then I feel bad about
      wasting time, and then I stare at the ceiling for 45 minutes and forget to
      answer an e-mail from three weeks ago. Again, it’s a cycle! But I’m doing
      my best."

    title01: Love Life S2
    desc01: I did not really care for Love Life S1—there were parts of it that made
      me feel insane, actually—but oh my GOD, what an incredible departure. S2
      stars William Jackson Harper and I cannot wait for his ascent into romcom
      hunk for the foreseeable future. This season made me cry? Somehow? So, so,
      so good. Watch it on [HBO
      Max](https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GXrxUzQ5VqrGGtAEAAAAd).

    title02: The Green Knight
    desc02: When A24 first dropped the trailer for [this
      movie](https://a24films.com/films/the-green-knight), I was like “oh,
      something that’s almost perfect for me!” because I thought it was a horror
      Arthurian retelling starring Dev Patel; turns it, out WAS perfect for me
      because it was not, in fact, horror, just really weird! I loved this
      vibrant and slow movie so much and Dev Patel really is one of the most
      beautiful men acting right now.

    title01: Red (Taylor’s Version)
    desc01: "[Red](https://open.spotify.com/album/6kZ42qRrzov54LcAk4onW9?si=XUY9-NB\
      fRZ-9VdAzUmVqcQ) has always been one of my favorite Taylor Swift albums—it
      basically singlehandedly got me through high school and college, has seen
      me through multiple crushes and relationships (and subsequent breakups),
      and is a great fall soundtrack imho. I love the rerecorded version so
      much, especially new tracks like [Nothing
      New](https://open.spotify.com/track/01K4zKU104LyJ8gMb7227B?si=a7f9f439f87\
      14ee2) and [Message In A
      Bottle](https://open.spotify.com/track/3z6XUommYDWPHeFhmhhT6j?si=e094b6c0\
      00cb4682). And that’s without even getting into the 10-minute version
      of [All Too
      Well,](https://open.spotify.com/track/5enxwA8aAbwZbf5qCHORXi?si=e1b2dcff7\
      a0d4bc1) a song that has always had an extra-special place in my heart.
      Every year, I think: *this is the year Taylor Swift will finally not be
      the number one artist in my Spotify Wrapped—*and every year I am wrong."

    title02: Baths
    desc02: The other day, I walked into my bathroom to take a quick shower before
      dinner, and I was like, *what’s stopping me from taking a bath right
      now?* Nothing! So I did. I broke out a bottle of Dr Teal’s from under my
      sink, lit a candle, and let myself soak in the warm water for an hour to
      avoid having to watch it get dark outside way too early—and it was great.
      I don’t know why I don’t take baths more often. If you have a usable
      bathtub (if you’re in New York, good luck) I very much recommend
      just…taking a bath every once in a while. It doesn’t need to be a special
      occasion. It doesn’t need to take very long. You don’t need any special
      products. Just let yourself sit in some warm water and ignore your
      responsibilities for a little bit.
