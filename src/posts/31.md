  intro:
    topic: social media
    jillian: "It’s time for my scheduled annual spiral about social media—that
      lovely time of year when I wonder what I’m doing on Instagram and Twitter,
      what I’m trying to get out of it, what I should be posting, who I actually
      care about following, and what it all means. The cycle goes like this: I
      decide I want to spend less time feeling bad on social media, so I
      unfollow a bunch of accounts that aren’t contributing to my life in a
      meaningful way to clear up my feed and make it easier to less time
      scrolling and more time seeing only the content I care about; a week
      later, I get bored and decide I’m not getting enough out of social media,
      so I find and follow a bunch of new accounts that are exciting or
      inspiring to me in some way; then, the cycle continues. Maybe the trick is
      to make peace with this ebb and flow of being very online, instead of
      feeling weird and bad about it. Maybe the trick is just *not overthinking
      it*. For now, I still don’t really know what I’m doing and I still feel
      very conflicted about the way I use social media—but if I figure it out,
      I’ll let you know."
    summer: I’ve lived most of my life online. I found my first internet friends
      when I was 10, feeling alone, caring too much about too many things; I’m
      22 now, and sort of the same. My friends are far away, my boyfriend is far
      away, my family is far away. I’ve loved so many people from such a
      distance. As social media becomes part of everyone’s social habits,
      inextricable from the “real world,” those friendships are stronger, but
      they’re intertwined with everything that sucks. I read about a shooting
      and wish my friend a happy birthday in the same thought; I read about my
      people fighting for their freedom and see others celebrating a game before
      I finish the headline. I never want to be an old man shouting at a cloud.
      We can all care about so, so many things, and that is how I got here in
      the first place. I never want to dismiss the lifesaving connections social
      media has brought me. I don’t know how to navigate my escapism collapsing
      into what I escape from, even though it’s been happening for years—even
      more, I don’t know how to deal with the fact that I don’t want to escape
      anymore. I want to *know.* I don’t want distance. From anyone, from
      anything.

    title01: Reconstructions by Bradley Trumpfheller
    desc01: My friend has a chapbook and it’s one of the most stunning things you
      will read in 2020. (I don’t care that it’s only January!) Bradley is
      ridiculously talented. Each of their poems just feels in love with the
      medium, in love with the page, trying to run off of it—there’s an elegance
      to the weight of just how *impressive* their work is. I read it on a plane
      & studied it for hours after. It deserves so, so much attention. You can
      buy *Reconstructions* on the [Sibling Rivalry Press
      website!](https://siblingrivalrypress.bigcartel.com/product/reconstructions-by-bradley-trumpfheller)

    title02: "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series"
    desc02: When the [trailer
      dropped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlaV8sJGhfc) for this show, all I
      could think was *this is for me.* I’m a survivor of the Glee fandom (as is
      Jillian), and yes! It did warp my brain! I am hungry for disaster
      surrounded by a song (this explains why I can’t stop thinking about *CATS
      (2019),* too)! I wanted this show to be like *Riverdale,* or *Nancy
      Drew,* just absurd and a good time and makes you think *wait, am I so
      irony-poisoned that I’ve turned this into my favorite show?* BUT! TWIST!
      This show is actually fucking great! No irony! Full seriousness! It holds
      all of the camp and cradles it, it acknowledges its predecessors (*HSM* as
      much as *Glee* as much as all other teen comedies), and does so, so good
      by its teens. Basically everyone gets complexity, everyone gets a full
      life, they are kind, they are mean, and they are jealous, but never
      cartoonishly or destructively. They sing well but it doesn’t feel
      like, *oh ok cool we love 30-year-old Broadway veterans*. There are
      characters of color, there are queer characters (QPOC, even!) There’s a
      Palestinian flag! Just! In the background of a scene? Yes, reader, I
      cried! Watch it on Disney+, my reluctant ally.

    title01: How To Do Nothing
    desc01: "I think everyone should be required to read [this
      book](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781612197494), full stop. I
      highlighted lines on nearly every page, but here is a favorite, from the
      introduction, that will give you a sense of what this book is all about:
      “The point of doing nothing, as I define it, isn’t to return to work
      refreshed and ready to be more productive, but rather to question what we
      currently perceive as productive.” This is not just a book about
      birdwatching and quitting Facebook—it is a book about collective action
      and shared public spaces and attention and art and community. If you’ve
      read it, DM me so we can talk. If you haven’t, you need to fix that."

    title02: Shrill
    desc02: I looked through our archives to see if we had already mentioned [this
      show](https://www.hulu.com/series/shrill-54eab813-3a9b-496d-9d7e-908597ad8d1a),
      because I was *sure* we had—but somehow, no! Which is a problem, because
      this show is brilliant and funny and makes me feel so good. The second
      season just came out on Hulu, and we are all so lucky.
