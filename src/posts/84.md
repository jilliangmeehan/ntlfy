  intro:
    topic: Spring
    jillian: Itâ€™s been a bit of a rainy, gloomy week here. The weather has been very
      back and forthâ€”some days are warm and sunny, some days are cold again,
      some days canâ€™t quite figure out what they want to be. But today I woke up
      to sun pouring into my apartment, and the cherry blossom trees are close
      to blooming, and I can already feel myself breaking out of a months-long
      winter slump. Sometimes I forget how much I need all this sun and warmth
      until I finally have it and I realize that Iâ€™m having the best day Iâ€™ve
      had in a long time. (Vitamin D gummies and a SAD lamp on my desk donâ€™t
      quite cut it when the sun is setting at 4 pm every day.) Spring isnâ€™t
      quite here in New York, but itâ€™s coming, and Iâ€™m ready for it.
    summer: By contrast, it is very hot in California! The sun has been really nice,
      actually, and thereâ€™s a gentle breeze. I forget every time spring comes
      around that Iâ€™m someone with nasty seasonal allergies, though, so thereâ€™s
      always that adjustment. Iâ€™m doing my best to get outside more; the sun
      being out longer is definitely encouraging that. After winter, I honestly
      forget that it can be 6PM and still light out enough for a walk! Iâ€™ve been
      enjoying my after-work walks, and know itâ€™s making me healthier; being
      crouched at my little job all and then transforming into my hermit persona
      at 5PM is definitely not sustainable, even if it is roughly my entire
      being from October-January. Welcome, Spring!

    title01: Our Flag Means Death
    desc01: So if youâ€™ve talked to me any time in the last two weeks, you
      knowÂ [this](https://www.hbomax.com/a/grw-ofd?utm_id=sa%7C71700000090444750%7C58700007646669406%7Cp69081306402&gclid=CjwKCAjwur-SBhB6EiwA5sKtjkxIUWBlFlCH7YoiIGa70l5YCxxNHkVf8TL7ctMq9bTOiXGaIoygJBoCJacQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)Â is
      the only thing I can think about. An HBOMax romantic-comedy series about
      pirates! My goodness. The main word I can use for this show
      isÂ *healing.*Â So long Iâ€™ve felt insane by the way cis male showrunners
      talk about the desire on part of fans for queer romance between characters
      who fall so clearly in romantic beats; that insanity is not present in
      this show. Everything you think is true. Itâ€™s also very funny and joyful!
      What more do we deserve! (A SEASON 2!!!!!!!!)

    title02: My Grief, the Sun by Sanna Wanni
    desc02: I just moved and had been ordering books over the course of March to the
      new place, andÂ [this
      book](https://bookshop.org/books/my-grief-the-sun/9781487010843)Â was on
      top of the stackâ€”it was also the one I was most excited for! I feel like I
      can recommend this book to everyone just because of how incredibly diverse
      it is; there are gorgeous, intricate lyrical sections, collage poems,
      erasures, and a great prose section to end it allâ€”also, thereâ€™s a Princess
      Mononoke suite! What more do you need? I cried at a few of the poems and
      took pictures of a few others and immediately sent them to people I know.
      Sanna is so special.

    title01: The Kingâ€™s Affection
    desc01: Iâ€™ve been on a bit of a kdrama kick lately, andÂ [this
      one](https://www.netflix.com/title/81430282)Â quickly became one of my
      favorites. All I will say about it is itâ€™s a historical kdrama that
      explores gender and sexuality and complicated family dynamics, and it made
      me cry a lot.

    title02: Business Proposal
    desc02: Okay, another kdrama for you. This one is new (the last two episodes
      just aired onÂ [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81509440)Â a couple
      of weeks ago) and I had a really fun time watching it every week. Itâ€™s a
      classic fake dating romance, and itâ€™s just very fun and adorable. Maybe
      not one of my all time favorites, but definitely a comfort show.
