  intro:
    topic: nostalgia
    jillian: I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because Iâ€™m bored, or because Iâ€™m desperately
      searching for new coping mechanisms in the middle of all of this, but Iâ€™ve
      been spending a lot of time thinking about a reaching for experiences I
      had growing up. Last night, after a couple glasses of wine, I went down a
      rabbit hole searching for all the old MMORPGs I used to play. (Pixie
      Hollow, anyone? Virtual Magic Kingdom? Toontown? Bring them back!) Iâ€™ve
      been heavily considering joining Summer as she rewatches Glee from the
      beginning. And now I guess Stephanie Meyer is publishing Midnight Sun,
      which, alright! Nostalgia is not always a good thing, but Iâ€™m finding it
      comforting these days, when little else is. It makes sense that weâ€™d want
      to turn our minds to a past in which we could go outside without masks on,
      and enjoy the things that occupied our time when we were younger and had
      less to worry aboutâ€”I think itâ€™s okay to let yourself lean into the
      nostalgia a little bit! Make a playlist of songs you loved in high school.
      Revisit your favorite movies and TV shows and books and games, even if
      they arenâ€™t as good now, just to scratch the itch. And then return to the
      present, because there is nothing more important than paying attention to
      what is happening around us right now.
    summer: Weâ€™re 7-ish weeks into quarantine, which means Iâ€™ve been rewatching a
      lot of TV. Nostalgia used to feel like an ugly word, a feeling I would
      wrinkle my nose at when I heard people talk about past eras. I now know
      this is because I was truly too young, and most of the nostalgia my peers
      had was constructed by media that told them to feel nostalgic for a time
      they never experienced. It felt artificial and white-washy, likeÂ *why
      would you want to experience a time in which the world was noticeably so
      much worse.*Â Revisiting things from 2009 or 2012, though, I find myself
      nostalgic not for the Obama era (lmao) but the way that media carried me.
      Mostly, Iâ€™m thinking about shows like Glee, where I can trace so much of
      my fandom lineage, and that I can thank for so many of my friends (like
      Jillian ðŸ˜€), the way I think about media, and the way I process discourse
      and conflictâ€”my patience was never tested more than hiatus weeks, but the
      absoluteÂ *content*Â those breaks generated. Unparalleled. I wasnâ€™t in a
      great place mentally back then, but I can still pull fondness when I think
      about my shows. Something to be excited about. Something to make you feel
      something. Iâ€™m trying to hold onto things to be excited aboutâ€”and right
      now, that manifests in reliving my urgency for a new episode of Glee each
      week.

    title01: Zaina Alsousâ€™s A Theory of Birds
    desc01: I recommend a lot of poetry in this newsletter, to the point where it
      seems like Iâ€™ve probably never read a novel,
      butÂ [Zainaâ€™s](https://zainaalsous.com/)Â collection gave me the feeling of
      reading a very immersive piece of fictionâ€”not saying her work reads as
      prose in anyway, nor is it escapism, but thereâ€™s this incredible balance
      between intricacy and simplicity. Those words are not necessarily at odds,
      but the weight of Zainaâ€™s work never feels overwhelming, rather
      gravitational. I was excited to turn each page, excited to see what else
      she had in store for her reader. This is a work I will revisit over and
      over and over againâ€”I read each poem twice, wanting to give them all of my
      time, poking at Hazem to read along with me several times so that they got
      the attention they deserved. Itâ€™s brilliant. Itâ€™s brilliant.

    title02: Never Have I Ever
    desc02: Truly, I was hesitant to begin this show after the last few seasons of
      The Mindy Project, but that all faded away after the first episode. I love
      seeing high school shows that do away with strict caste (especially in
      contrast to the Glee Iâ€™ve been watching) and instead focus on the
      realistic fluidity of relationships; familiarity is present among
      basically everyone, itâ€™s easy to be friends and find common ground with
      pretty much anyone when youâ€™re in the same classes. Devi is a fantastic
      characterâ€”ridiculously funny and every mistake feels earned (again, in
      contrast to Glee). The side characters are precious and have stories Iâ€™m
      excited about, tooâ€”they are not set-dressing, so much the opposite in fact
      that assuming so is an addressed conflict. The Sherman Oaks setting is
      used with such a wonderful specificity and I am a sucker for anything in
      LA suburbs. Also there are a lot of hot people! Itâ€™s on Netflix, go enjoy!

    title01: The Creative Independent newsletter
    desc01: The content that The Creative Independent puts out is always
      fantasticâ€”beautiful essays about writing and other types of creative work;
      interviews with artists, musicians, and creators of all sorts; and guides
      for just about everything (fromÂ [how to write a
      poem](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-write-a-poem/)Â toÂ [how
      to lose
      someone](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-lose-someone/))â€”but
      theirÂ [daily newsletter](https://thecreativeindependent.com/)Â is my
      favorite way to experience what they have to offer. My most recent
      favorite featured
      anÂ [interview](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/jenny-odell-on-taking-the-time-you-need-to-notice-think-and-grow/)Â with
      Jenny Odell, author ofÂ *How To Do Nothing*, which we have
      alsoÂ [recommended](https://letterstosummer.com/31). Go read it
      immediately, and then subscribe.

    title02: ACNH Travel Guide
    desc02: This probably isnâ€™t news to anyone, but Iâ€™ve been playing a lot of
      Animal Crossing New Horizons lately. I want to give a shout-out toÂ [this
      super nice companion app](http://acnhtravelguide.com/)Â that Iâ€™ve been
      using that makes it easy to see which bugs and fish are in season (and
      available at the time youâ€™re playing), what youâ€™ve already found and
      donated to the museum, what events are coming up, and tons more. It also
      has links to other great community resources, so you can test out new
      island tunes or track and predict your turnip prices without leaving the
      app. Download for iOSÂ [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1502818559).
