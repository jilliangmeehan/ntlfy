  intro:
    jillian: I am frantically writing this newsletter at the very last minute on my
      iPad because I’m in San Jose this week for 🔥 conference hell 🔥 and I
      haven’t really had time to do anything other than eat burritos in between
      meeting people. I’m so dehydrated but I’m having the best time! I’m
      at [Layers](https://layers.is/), which is a really incredible design
      conference made by really incredible people. This is my second year going,
      and I just love it.
    summer: I have no excuse for not having done anything for this letter this week
      except wow I am TIRED and I can’t believe I graduated only two weeks ago.
      Also I aged last week! Happy 22 to me. Maybe the next letter will have an
      update on my job stuff.

    title01: Bon Appetit’s Best Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe
    desc01: As you may know, I am obsessed with everything BA does. Claire was one
      of my first recommendations for this newsletter & I have only grown fonder
      and fonder of all of the other test kitchen chefs. Just recently did I
      realize I could actually just like, do the recipes? [So Madi & I made
      Chris’s
      cookies!](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-chocolate-chip-cookies) And
      they were amazing! And ridiculously easy (only 1 bowl!) I’ve never made
      brown butter before and it’s the best smell of all time and why isn’t it a
      candle? Bath & Body Works, hire me!

    title02: Hadestown Live Cast Recording
    desc02: I love musicals and I am deeply invested in any iteration of the
      Orpheus/Eurydice myth, so God made something perfect and beautiful
      specifically for me. I’m not that great at talking about music, but I know
      that Damon Daunno has made me weep several times in the past few weeks
      just from singing stuff. The proper stage cast album should come out soon?
      Maybe tomorrow? But in the meantime,
      listen [here](https://open.spotify.com/album/5aNyKdMPAPihA6n5BXTkLX?si=B96AOTyXQbW-r_yF6Ocg-g).

    title01: Worry list
    desc01: "I’ve been trying to develop a mindfulness routine—30ish minutes every
      day where I sit down, think about how I’m feeling, and meditate a bit.
      I’ve
      mentioned [Youper](https://letterstosummer.substack.com/p/13?utm_campaign\
      =post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy), [Calm](https://letterstosummer.sub\
      stack.com/p/8-?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy),
      and [Jour](https://letterstosummer.substack.com/p/-9-time-isnt-real?utm_c\
      ampaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy) in this newsletter before,
      which are all apps that have been really helpful for me lately. But I
      recently started adding a step to my routine that’s kind of a
      game-changer: For 5–10 minutes, I write down everything I’m thinking
      about, everything that’s causing me stress and making it hard to clear my
      head. I get it all out. Then, I look back at what I wrote and figure out
      what I can do about each thing—like adding a task to my to-do list, making
      a note to talk to my therapist about it, or even just telling myself that
      it’s going to be fine. And then I delete everything and move on. I call it
      my “worry list,” and as simple as it sounds, adding it to my daily routine
      has helped me let go of some of the anxious thoughts that distract me from
      the good stuff."

    title02: Booksmart
    desc02: "There are probably lots of people on the internet saying way smarter
      things than me about [this movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489887/),
      so I will just say: I really, really loved it. It’s just fun and goofy and
      it made me cry and laugh a whole bunch. I wish I’d had a movie like this
      when I was in high school, but I’m glad we get to exist with it in the
      world now. I want to see it a million more times."
