  intro:
    jillian: I’m in a book! The wonderful people
      at [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) have put together a book full of some of
      the projects made by the Glitch community this year, and I’m in
      it! [shouldidoit.glitch.me](https://shouldidoit.glitch.me/) is a website I
      made one afternoon because my boyfriend has a really hard time saying no
      to freelance work, and I wanted to make a tool that would help him figure
      out which projects are actually worth taking on—turns out that’s something
      a lot of us need. Check it out on page 20 of [Looky What We
      Made](https://glitch.com/culture/looky-what-we-made/).
    summer: MY SEMESTER IS DONE AND I CAN RELAX (while I sift through fifteen books
      on diasporic poetry and poetics of memory!). All I want to do is watch
      cartoons, read poems, and make the occasional profit from editing other
      people’s work. Please send people to [my
      DMs](https://twitter.com/summabis) if they need some extra eyes. I have
      two that actually work really poorly but I do wear glasses!

    title01: the specimen’s apology by George Abraham, illustrated by Leila Abdelrazaq
    desc01: George is my friend & kin & community; we found each other by way of
      Palestinian flags in our Twitter bios and, I would say, have been pals
      since. In addition to being my friend, they are also one of the most
      prolific writers I know, with a gajillion pubs that are all like, the Best
      Poem(s) You’ve Ever Read, a full length collection coming way of 2020, and
      their already-released chapbook *al youm* is a masterpiece, demonstrating
      their ridiculous mastery of language as image and text as formula all at
      once. the specimen’s apology is no different, building and building upon
      George’s talent, making me wish I knew more math, making me re-read over &
      over again, making me want to write, making me warm, giving that
      overwhelming feeling of so much-ness. The illustrations by Leila are
      eerie/stunning, too, a perfect complement to George’s eerie/stunning work.

    title02: Claire Saffitz making Gourmet Kit Kats
    desc02: I was introduced to [Gourmet
      Makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nqJiBRNQuw&index=4&list=PLKtIunYVkv_RezN3GB12YA8orYOScQUdA) by
      two friends attempting to reel me in from an anxiety spiral…it was the
      perfect choice. It is a well-known fact that I love watching food get made
      and I also love people trying their best and Claire Saffitz is a beautiful
      combination of both. The most wonderful thing about this series is the
      absolute lack of payoff—Claire presents perfectly recreated junk food to
      her colleagues at Bon Appetit, they take a bite, and say *good job*. It
      seems anticlimactic, but I know the feeling captured in her tired smile. I
      can’t say I’ve replicated kit-kats before in my kitchen’s shitty, shitty
      oven, but I have cooked meals that my friends have liked. I have cooked
      meals that my friends have liked even though I was floundering the entire
      time. The affirmation that even though you don’t know what you are
      doing, *you do know what you are doing* is the only good feeling. The
      payoff is joy. You can learn a little food science, too.

    title01: Stardew Valley multiplayer
    desc01: >-
      [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) might be only good thing
      we have left in this world, truly. If you don’t already know what it is,
      please google it, because I do not have time to explain to you how
      wonderful it is to log off for a few hours and escape into a world where
      the only thing I have to worry about is my adorable farm and its adorable
      chickens and my adorable purple-haired wife, Abigail.


      Stardew Valley recently added multiplayer support for [PC](https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-3-multiplayer-update-is-now-available/) and the [Switch](https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-3-multiplayer-update-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-this-week/) and it is…fantastic. I’ve coaxed my boyfriend into playing with me a few times, and I plan to bug all of my friends to start playing with me too, because my dream has always been to live in side-by-side cabins and water plants with the people I love.

    title02: Furry coats
    desc02: I recently met the love of my life and it
      is [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqsKzeIFvu7/) ridiculous furry blue
      coat that I bought myself as “self-care.” Ever since I read [this Amanda
      Mull
      piece](https://www.racked.com/2017/11/3/16577514/silly-coat-faux-fur-fun) on
      silly winter coats, I’ve been jealous of everyone I see wearing huge,
      furry, colorful jackets like it’s the most casual thing in the world. So I
      finally did it! And it was the best purchase I’ve made in a long time.
      10/10 highly recommend.
