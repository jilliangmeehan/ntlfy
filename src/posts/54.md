  intro:
    topic: moving
    jillian: As a kid, I don’t think I ever lived in one place longer than ten
      years; and as an adult I’ve never stayed in an apartment longer than
      three. Having one place to call home for dozens of years sounds like a
      nice fantasy, but I have a hard time picturing a future that doesn’t
      include moving from one tiny Brooklyn apartment to another every few
      years. At the end of this month, I’ll be moving out of a neighborhood I’ve
      lived in for three years, out of an apartment I’ve lived in for two, and
      into a studio where I’ll be living alone for the first time in my life.
      It’s weird and scary and exciting and stressful and cool and I just want
      it to be over as soon as possible. I’m trying not to think about the fact
      that the bedroom I’m in right now won’t be my bedroom anymore in a few
      weeks, and the bagel place on the corner won’t be my bagel place, and the
      view from the balcony won’t be my view. Instead, I’m trying to think about
      making a brand new home for myself—at least for the next few years.
    summer: "The first big move I remember was Michigan to California; as I consider
      this fact, I realize I only remember the arrival: Pasadena, a furnished
      apartment, a weird loft-area I became obsessed with, insisting any place
      we lived in California once we transitioned from company-loaned
      rental *had* to have one. I cannot remember the act of packing up my first
      childhood bedroom; I remember a garage sale. I remember a box of Pokemon
      cards my brother and I commonly cite as a Big Mistake to sell (we didn’t
      actually have anything rare, but it’s fun to pretend a life with no debt
      because of Pokemon). Since then, I have moved into a dorm, I have moved
      into an apartment, I have moved into a psuedo-house, and into another
      apartment; every time, I’ve had a legion of loved ones assisting me. A
      friend who knows how to make the space in a suitcase count. My mother
      attempting to get my security deposit back with her thorough cleaning. My
      dad with a rented Volvo, the seats pushed down and my desk dismantled in
      the back, boxes of books stacked upon it. In a pandemic, I get none of
      this. My roommate and I absently watching episodes of Jeopardy, her
      wrapping the kitchenware we care about in bubblewrap as I lay on the
      ground using my inhaler. There is dust everywhere. In a few days, people
      we love will come wearing masks to relieve us of donations. We will
      attempt ritual, to say goodbye to a place we loved. It won’t feel right."

    title01: You Exist Too Much by Zaina Arafat
    desc01: I have been WAITING to recommend this. This was my last read of 2020—it
      was a book that had been on my radar the entire year, but hadn’t been in
      the mood for until 11:40PM on a night in late December, for some reason! I
      basically stayed up all night reading it; [this
      book](https://books.catapult.co/products/you-exist-too-much-a-novel-by-zaina-arafat) is
      about a messy DJ-slash-MFA-student who checks herself into a rehab therapy
      center for love addiction. The story is framed in her past relationships,
      exploring the complicated ways family affects romance and romance affects
      family. It is so well-paced, it’s funny, it’s exciting, and emotionally
      devastating! Yes, I sobbed!!!! [Get it from your favorite
      Indie](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781948226509).

    title02: Tea after coffee
    desc02: I’m a caffeine addict who had a full-blown breakdown this morning upon
      realizing that I wouldn’t be able to drink coffee without leaving my
      apartment (moving sucks!). My parents are also big coffee people—when I am
      home, we basically each have 2-3 cups before breakfast. It’s fun, it’s
      traditional, it makes my entire body shake until I crash at 2:30PM and
      wish I was a child with little responsibility. I’ve been declining the
      very generous second cup of coffee, these days, replacing it with some
      kind of black tea ([chocolate pu
      erh](https://shop.numitea.com/Chocolate-Puerh/p/NUMIS-10360&c=NumiTeaStore@ByType@Indulgent) is
      my favorite right now). I know black tea also has a lot of caffeine, but
      it eases me into the afternoon better than all of that coffee.

    title01: Stardew Valley
    desc01: So, okay. Technically we have [already
      recommended](https://letterstosummer.com/3) Stardew Valley multiplayer,
      but we have not recommended [Stardew
      Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) just by itself. So I’m allowed!
      I’ve been playing this game on and off for years and it always gives me so
      much comfort—spending day after day watering my crops, talking to the
      townsfolk, and looking for ores in the mines. Perfect for people who
      played a lot of Harvest Moon as a kid, people who bought a Switch last
      year to play Animal Crossing and want to branch out, and people who like
      cute fishing minigames.

    title02: Media backlog
    desc02: I have never been good at keeping lists of movies to watch or books to
      read or games to play. There is so much stuff out there that I want to
      consume and it’s very overwhelming to have and maintain a huge list of all
      of that stuff. That said, a lot of my friends consistently recommend great
      stuff to me, and I never want to lose track of or forget about those
      recommendations—so I did what I do best and made myself a Notion page. Now
      I have a space to keep track of all the stuff I want to try, the things
      I’m in the middle of, and my ratings for things I’ve already finished. I’m
      starting slow and trying to keep it small and manageable by only add
      things that I actually want to, not just things I think I’m supposed to
      enjoy. I’m excited to see what it looks like in a few months once I’ve
      used it more, but for now, you can see it (and make a copy for your own
      Notion
      workspace) [here](https://www.notion.so/ff069a9e791345dcb0d4a364bd9a632f)!
