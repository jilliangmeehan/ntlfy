  intro:
    topic: astrology
    jillian: In high school, I remember borrowing a friend’s astrology book and
      staying up late to flip through it, trying to piece together my birth
      chart and what it all meant. Now I am intimately familiar with my birth
      chart—and my friends’ birth charts, thanks to Co-star—and follow astrology
      meme accounts on Instagram. If you ask me if I “believe” in astrology, I
      think you’re kind of missing the point. I don’t care if the position of
      the planets actually has any “real” affect on my life. I like astrology as
      a tool for thinking about my actions and who I am, for recognizing
      patterns in my life and the world around me, for learning how to make
      sense of things, for relating to people who also have Virgo in their
      charts, etc. It’s fun, and sometimes comforting, to read my horoscope or
      keep track of which planets are in retrograde or compare birth charts with
      friends. Reading that astrology book in high school felt like a big
      awakening for me—not just because I finally knew what it meant to have a
      Scorpio sun, but because I found a new way to look at things.
    summer: I started thinking more deeply about astrology when I was in high
      school, early college; I had friends (like Jillian) who Knew Their Shit
      and started talking about things I had never known about—moon signs,
      rising signs, how different placements affect the body. For someone who
      had always felt like there was something kind of *off* with their body,
      with their brain, it was comforting to point cosmologically to how I was
      feeling. It felt less like explanation and more like seeking precedence,
      more like an analytical tool to find the truth—not so much *blame it on
      the planets,* rather, *use the planets to figure out where exactly the
      core of this is coming from.* I never ended up digging as deep as other
      people I love did, nor did I ever familiarize myself with the full meaning
      of it all, but it’s something patiently, presently there at the back of my
      head. I like the reminders to check in with myself if there is a pisces
      moon, or letting mercury in retrograde remind me bad/frustrating things
      are not always within my control.

    title01: Salat by Dujie Tahat
    desc01: "I love chapbooks that use their space & form so well, chaps that feel
      like they *should* exist in this form: Dujie Tahat’s *Salat* is just
      that. [Dujie’s](https://dujietahat.com/bio/) writing is absolutely
      stunning—the book takes on the form of prayer, and each poem echoes that
      meditation so well. I read it cover to cover twice through as soon as I
      got it and have been thinking about it every week since. [You can buy it
      here](https://www.tupelopress.org/product/salat/)."

    title02: Rilo Kiley 1999
    desc02: I recommended the Rilo Kiley album *[The Execution of All
      Things](https://letterstosummer.com/23)* a while back. Their music has
      been in my regular rotation since that newsletter, basically, but this
      past week I let them be my main on-shuffle artist and found myself
      particularly drawn to their [self-titled, first
      album](https://open.spotify.com/album/7bYq6huhr7JsnkoPExW1Xz?si=rst-Mc0rT-m0pxxOtxsAlw).
      I’m not great at writing about music but there is something about Jenny
      Lewis’s voice that just makes me feel in-tune with myself, even if who I
      am at the current moment is pretty insufferable.

    title01: Cherry blossom trees
    desc01: I went to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden yesterday to see the cherry
      blossom and magnolia trees beginning to bloom and it put me in the best
      mood!!! Please, if you live somewhere that has pretty blooming trees right
      now, take some time to just go outside and admire them for a while. Take a
      bunch of pictures. Post them so other people can feel the good vibes.
      Enjoy!

    title02: Sandalwood incense
    desc02: "[Grand Tea Imports](https://grandteaimports.com/) has really good tea,
      and maybe I’ll recommend some of that another time, but I also really like
      their [sandalwood
      incense](https://grandteaimports.com/products/extra-thin-no-smoke-sandalw\
      ood-incense). Whenever I want some really cozy vibes, I light a stick of
      this in my living room and it completely resets my brain—it’s a signal
      that it’s time to relax for a second. Smells great, doesn’t fill the room
      with smoke, supports a small local business, 10/10."
