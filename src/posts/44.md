  intro:
    topic: burnout
    jillian: There are so many things that I want to do every day that I don’t have
      enough time for it all. At the same time, I’m too tired to do much of
      anything except sit at my desk all day and then watch TV or play video
      games for a few hours until it’s time for bed. But I want to do things! I
      want to walk to the park on my lunch break! I want to send postcards to my
      friends! I want to participate in a weekly book club! I want to knit
      socks! I want to make stuff! I want to learn! But, yes, I also want (and
      frankly *need*) to lay in bed with a cup of tea and do nothing. Sometimes
      I want to do that for the whole day. I don’t love it, but it is what it
      is. I’m working on it, I guess.
    summer: I’m so tired all of the time. I start so many letters like this. Jill
      and I pace this letter very well, and have taken the breaks we needed when
      we needed them; the practice of writing for the letter has never exhausted
      me, but sometimes I struggle with content because having things to
      recommend means *doing things* besides eating and playing Animal Crossing.
      I don’t want to say I feel burnt out from being a person? But sometimes?
      That’s what it feels like! I’ve experienced burnout from school and from
      writing and from my job; the only thing I’ve ever really taken a big break
      from, purposefully, was writing poetry. I’m not sure when I’ll fall back
      into it. Will I ever be a student again? Am I scarred? Maybe! All I know
      is I have a headache every morning and I’m still watching *Sex and the
      City,* slower than I’ve ever watched any show in my life probably*.* May
      we all feel energized again, soon.

    title01: DELUGE by Leila Chatti
    desc01: "August is the time for the Sealey Challenge, where you read a book of
      poetry every day (named for the poet who started it, Nicole Sealey, who I
      recommended in [one of our first letters](https://letterstosummer.com/2)).
      I’m 13 days strong, but haven’t really been able to stop thinking about my
      first day: DELUGE. Leila captures panic/confusion/betrayal of your body so
      wonderfully and heart-breakingly, composing a true arc. There is a climax
      point. There is an urgency to continue reading, one more akin to a
      thrilling novel. The book, as a physical object, is also stunning, which I
      generally expect from Copper Canyon. [Go get a
      copy](https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/deluge-by-leila-chatti/)!"

    title02: Nory Candy Shop
    desc02: "[Liana Aghajanian](https://twitter.com/LianaAgh) tweeted about this
      LA-based Armenian candy shop’s [GoFundMe for COVID
      relief](https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-56yr-old-small-family-run-candy-b\
      usiness) and mentioned that they also mail boxes of lokum/Turkish delight
      nationally…so I bought two boxes! It’s the best version I’ve ever had,
      better than the confectioner-sugar soaked boxes or the fresher, gooey-er
      Syrian versions selected at the Arab market by my parents’ home. I got a
      box of pomegranate and mango and it feels like such a special treat, and a
      wonderful break from the copious amounts of cookies and brownies I’ve been
      baking during quarantine. You can look at their offerings and
      order [here](https://www.norylocum.com/)."

    title01: Pride and Prejudice
    desc01: I’m not sure how many times I’ve watched [this
      movie](https://www.netflix.com/title/70032594), but I know it’s a lot.
      Most recently, with a group of friends on [Netflix
      Party](https://www.netflixparty.com/) so we could all scream into the chat
      together. (The hand flex! *The hand flex!!!*) It has never once failed to
      make me feel good, and no matter how many times I’ve seen it, it only gets
      more perfect each time. It’s on Netflix now! If you haven’t seen it, watch
      it now. And if you have, watch it again. And again, and again, and again.

    title02: The Untamed
    desc02: "Welcome to the thing that has fully consumed me for the past month, I
      guess! [The Untamed](https://www.netflix.com/title/81200228) is a
      live-action adaptation of a novel called [Mo Dao Zu
      Shi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Dao_Zu_Shi)—I will let you go down
      that rabbit hole by yourself. It is sort of about demons, but mostly about
      yearning, and it’s extremely cheesy but will also rip your heart out a
      little bit. My friends convinced me to watch it, and as we all know,
      everything is better when you share it with the people you care about.
      (Full disclosure: my preamble in [the last
      letter](https://letterstosummer.com/43/) was 100% about this show.)
      Listen: I can’t say it’s the best show I’ve ever seen in my life, but I
      have spent hours and hours and hours thinking about it, and I don’t think
      I’ll stop anytime soon. Do with that what you will."
