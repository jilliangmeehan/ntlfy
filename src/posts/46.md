  intro:
    topic: priorities
    jillian: "Guess what: I tried to do too many activities in my free time and now
      I’m exhausted because I spend way too many hours a day sitting at my desk
      and not enough hours a day doing things like “taking breaks” and “drinking
      water.” Classic me. The thing is, I want to do everything—I want to learn
      how to make 3d art, I want to play all the video games, I want to be a
      person who knits socks, I want to make cool stuff with my friends, etc.
      And the other thing is, I am terrified of starting a new project and then
      abandoning it. So in my very smart human brain, I only see two options: do
      all of the things every day forever, or do none of them. Turns out that’s
      really silly. Two people in my life (my therapist, and my friend Selena)
      keep telling me that it’s okay to want to do lots of things, and that it’s
      also okay to give up on those things for any reason. I’m learning this,
      slowly. I’m learning how to make time for things that matter to me while
      also making time to take care of myself as a person. I’m learning that
      maybe knitting is not for me, for example, but I can sign up for a 3d art
      course and spend a little bit of time each week learning how to do
      something new. Baby steps."
    summer: A few years ago I interned at the Getty. My commute to the museum was
      about 1.5-2hrs both ways, every day. I had to wake up around 5am, and go
      to sleep around 9 in order to actually obey my alarm. I got home around
      7PM each day. It was terrible! I was so tired, I felt unfulfilled by my
      job, and worst of all—I had to pick and choose the ways I wanted to wind
      down. There was no time to both play Breath of the Wild AND read. I
      couldn’t see my friends if I wanted to have dinner with my family. I just
      didn’t have time, no matter which way I swung it. When I went back to
      school, I found myself trying to do everything all of the time and never
      saying no—everything felt like it was my priority and so nothing felt like
      a priority. It’s taken me a while to start re-learning how to use my time
      and decide what I want, what’s important to me—these last few weeks, it’s
      been reading. I’m trying not to be mean to myself for writing not being a
      priority, or learning something new. It’s okay to return to my baseline.
      It’s okay for my day to only contain eating, working, reading, and sleep,
      even if I want thirty other things, too—soon, one day, I’ll have the
      energy.

    title01: The Vegetarian by Han Kang
    desc01: After my August poetry challenge, I’ve still healthily kept my appetite
      for reading; it’s September 10th and I’ve finished three books! *The
      Vegetarian,* handed to me confidently by my roommate when I said I needed
      to read a book for adults, was the answer. And holy shit! It’s so fucking
      weird I loved it! It’s reportedly an excellent translation from the
      original Korean, maintaining the wonderfully cheeky-bordering
      satirical-careful tone that makes the various POVs *work* instead of
      making you want to roll your eyes into space. It’s about a woman who
      becomes a vegetarian after having a violent dream, and the absolute absurd
      reactions of men around her. The descriptions of food are great. The
      descriptions of body-stuff are vivid and made me upset (in a good
      way!). [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101906118) or [bookshop
      it](https://bookshop.org/books/the-vegetarian/9781101906118)!

    title02: A Star Is Born (1954)
    desc02: Monday was my partner and I’s one-year anniversary and we celebrated by
      doing a marathon of all of the *Star Is Born* films (very cool and normal
      quarantine anniversary activities!). Although the 2018 one with Gaga will
      always hold a strange but special place in my heart, I was honestly so
      enchanted by the 1954 version. Judy Garland is obviously amazing, and the
      entire movie is so BEAUTIFUL and uses color SO WELL. I love musicals! I
      love them. Judy Garland will always be a treasure. We had to rent it, but
      it was worth it!

    title01: Slowtember
    desc01: "Maybe you’ve heard of Inktober: the month of daily drawing prompts
      every October that (to me, at least) sounds a bit intimidating and too
      overwhelming to even attempt. This year, there’s a new guy in
      town—[Slowtember](https://twitter.com/megaelod/status/1299348851405590528\
      ?s=21) is a series of art prompts for the month of September. The twist
      here is that you have a few days to complete the prompts, and you have two
      options to choose from for each piece. I know we’re already a little over
      a week into the month, but if you’re looking for a chiller alternative to
      Inktober, this is the one. I’ve been trying out [pixel
      art](https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1300917215731089410?s=21) \
      for the first time and turning all my finished pieces into [sweaters in
      Animal
      Crossing](https://twitter.com/wafflecrossing/status/1301213430691528704?s\
      =21), and I’m having a lot of fun with it."

    title02: 5 min/day
    desc02: I came across [this blog post](https://www.katfukui.com/5-min-day) by
      Kat Fukui a couple of weeks ago, and it inspired me to start taking time
      at the end of each workday to write a list of what I did that day and what
      I want to focus on the next day. Sounds simple, but it can have a big
      impact if you’re feeling overwhelmed by everything on your plate or just
      need some extra reassurance that you are actually getting work done. My
      lists tend to be a mix of work stuff (finished a task I’ve been working on
      for a while) and personal stuff (didn’t eat lunch at my desk), and I like
      to add an emoji to the top to track my mood.
