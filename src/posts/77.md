  intro:
    topic: fantasy
    jillian: I think as soon as it starts getting colder every year, I start leaning
      toward fantasy. Not that I don’t love it year-round, but I’m less likely
      to act on it when the temperate is above 50 degrees. I’m always drawn to
      the idea of fantasy, the vibes of it, the way it makes me feel just to
      think about it in my head—but something about wintertime especially makes
      me want to rewatch Lord of the Rings or read a book with an undercurrent
      of magic and ghosts. I think I am not so good at talking about why I like
      fantasy or what I find compelling about it, but I know in my gut that it
      makes me feel a certain type of way that other genres just can’t. Fantasy
      is for cups of hot beverages and blankets and candles, for snow and rain
      and wind outside, for being so immersed in a story that you forget to move
      or think or exist for several hours. It is the ultimate comfort, to me,
      and I wish I indulged in it more.
    summer: Later this month, the issue of FIYAHLIT I was a guest editor for will be
      released. Leading up to this incredible opportunity, I had been thinking a
      lot about fantasy, about the speculative, about the possibilities of
      other/different/better worlds. Like most kids, I read SO MUCH fantasy—I
      was obsessed with literally anything fantastical; I loved myths, I loved
      the opportunities folklore presented, I loved every monster that could
      also be beautiful. I took a break, for a while, and turned my focus to
      literary fiction and poetry—slowly, though, I’ve been easing back into the
      things I love and trying to marry them to what I am passionate about now.
      Poetry is a speculative space, has opportunity for the fantastical not
      just in metaphor but in concrete—I’ve enjoyed just dreamily laying around
      and thinking about the reality-bending worlds I could build in verse, the
      lushness poetry gives and how to complement what I used to devour. I’ve
      been thinking about imaginations, and everything I restrict myself from
      thinking, remembering to ask questions of my questions—all of these
      instincts, latent for years, but really born from my most childish
      instinct of *why not?* Re-immersing myself in the fantastical—and more
      diverse versions of it, and not just books—has been healing and fun and
      generative in so many ways.

    title01: Tidesong by Wendy Xu
    desc01: I’ve recommended other work by Wendy Xu,
      but *[Tidesong](http://www.artofwendyxu.com/tidesong)* is their debut
      authorartist graphic novel! It’s a gorgeous middle-grade book about a kid
      witch who visits family to hone her skills before auditioning for a fancy
      magic school. It’s got big Kiki’s Delivery Service vibes but with WIND
      MAGIC and DRAGONS and it just made me feel so warm and excited.

    title02: tick…tick..BOOM!
    desc02: Truthfully, this wouldn’t be my first recommendation but I’ve mostly
      been rewatching *What We Do in the Shadows* and playing Zelda games SO!
      Here’s a movie musical that was pleasantly, surprisingly enjoyable! Andrew
      Garfield is super dreamy and the clear love put into each musical number
      makes up for the less-than-stellar soundtrack. The plot is absolutely
      enhanced by the reality of what happens to Jonathan Larson, and so in many
      ways the execution as a movie is maybe…better…than on the stage? I
      couldn’t tell you for sure because it’s likely I’ll never see a piece of
      live theater again, but hey! This is
      on [Netflix](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjPleeY0sb0AhXWkokEHc9-BQkQtwJ6BAgQEAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F81149184&usg=AOvVaw18yE_gs58qVawsLushjIgP).
      Bring back movie musicals made by people who actually like musicals!!!!!!

    title01: re:treat
    desc01: I’ve been working on making a big playlist of music I can put on in the
      background while I’m working, because I’m getting a little tired of
      listening to the same lofi mixes on YouTube all the time. Today, while
      picking some songs to add to the playlist, I revisited [this
      album](https://open.spotify.com/album/3aivd8TlgMV01IEQQraFVQ?si=_oYLLRr8RLWvQBVosft3vQ) by
      Leon Chang that I really love. It samples a lot of Animal Crossing music
      in a fun way, and it just makes me happy to listen to while I’m puttering
      around my apartment doing my silly little tasks.

    title02: No Time to Die
    desc02: I went nearly 25 years of my life without seeing a single James Bond
      film, and then this year I finally watched a whole bunch of them,
      including all of the Daniel Craig ones (which I loved). So [this
      movie](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiL06mJ0sb0AhVvlIkEHSPeDR4QFnoECFAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt2382320%2F&usg=AOvVaw2qoLQcMuUBYXfnw48CfYw9) really
      came out at the perfect time for me. I saw it in theaters on one of the
      last possible days that I could, and when I got home, I had to rewatch the
      trailers for all of the other movies in the series so I could figure out
      which one was my favorite. I decided No Time to Die *isn’t* my favorite,
      but I still really loved it, and I thought it was a really great ending to
      the series. So this isn’t so much a recommendation for this specific movie
      as it is a recommendation for *all* of the Daniel Craig Bond films—go
      watch them all!
