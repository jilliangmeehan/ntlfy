    topic: waiting
    jillian-topic: I’ve been waiting for a lot of things lately—warm weather, a
      camping trip with friends, the new Fire Emblem game, fun stuff in the
      mail, etc. Every day I wake up with something to wait for. Sometimes
      waiting is nice; it gives me something to look forward to, something to
      plan for. Other times, it sucks and drives me out of my mind. Even those
      moments when the anticipation feels unbearable can be nice, though. It
      feels good (and very human) to want something so bad it hurts, to need
      something so much that you’re counting down the days until it arrives. I
      would never give up the waiting if it meant less joy.
    summer-topic: I’ve applied to a lot of things lately; fellowships, submitted to
      lit mags, chapbook prizes, etc, and let me tell you—the waiting is
      agonizing? I don’t think I’ve ever had my name sitting in the inboxes of
      this many decision-makers at once before. I find myself refreshing my
      e-mail way more obsessively than normal, checking at the “In progress” box
      on Submittable way more than is normal. I’m kind of anxious always! It
      sucks. I am impatient, by nature, too, so it’s no wonder the waiting-game
      part of writing and writing community kind of kills me. I’m impatient to
      know what happens but also don’t want time to pass? It’s a recipe for
      disaster and keeps me from trying, sometimes. It’s good to know what we
      can handle and what to take on vs not take on, of course, but wow! I wish
      waiting wasn’t something I struggled with so much, considering it will
      always happen, no matter what.

    summer-title01: Thirty Names of Night by Zeyn Joukhadar
    summer-desc01: I just finished this book about a half hour ago as I am typing
      this and oh my god!!!!! I think I was near-tears the entirety of it and
      then sobbed at the end. This is an ACHINGLY beautiful book that alternates
      between the story of a Syrian American trans boy who is mourning his
      mother, taking care of his grandmother, and generally navigating the
      world; he stumbles upon a notebook by the artist Laila Z, a Syrian
      American painter who mysteriously disappeared decades again. His mother,
      an ornithologist, had been obsessed with her art. Laila Z’s journal
      details the life of Syrian immigrants in Little Syria, a neighborhood of
      Manhattan that would ultimately be destroyed; it’s such a special, special
      book. I feel lucky to be alive at the same time as Zeyn. [Check it

    summer-title02: "frank: sonnets by Diane Seuss"
    summer-desc02: I try not to recommend the same type of thing twice in one letter
      but I’ve really only been reading the past few weeks, so here we go! [This
      book](https://bookshop.org/books/frank-sonnets/9781644450451) won the
      Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the LA Times
      Book Prize so I thought weeeellll maybe I should just check it out. I’d
      seen poems by Diane Seuss before and loved every single one of them, so
      I’m not sure why it took me so long to read one of her collections? But
      holy shit! This book fucking rules! I love her sonnets; they have the
      energy of a prose poem (my poetic home!)—a rush of energy, urgent,
      scattered, passionate—I felt like I needed to take a picture of every page
      and show everyone I knew just how ridiculously each poem was. The
      retrospective-childhood-narrative poems are spectacular, the conversations
      with writers and artists are spectacular, my goodness. It’s just all so
      good. I think, too, this is a book I would recommend for someone who isn’t
      necessarily into poetry; the consistent sonnet-length keeps the prose
      poems from becoming dense, instead creates a really steady rhythm in the
      collection itself. Her language is accessible, the images vivid. Ugh.
      Awards committees really got it right this time.

    jillian-title01: "& I was so young when I behaved 25: poems"
    jillian-desc01: This is my newsletter so I get to use it to promote my
      friends!!! Also this is a real, actual recommendation because I got my
      copy of [Summer’s birthday chapbook](https://ko-fi.com/summabis/shop) last
      week and loved it—I texted her my reactions the entire time I was reading
      it. If you haven’t already gotten yourself a copy of Summer’s
      Mitski-inspired poetry chapbook (available either digital or printed!),
      please do that right now.
