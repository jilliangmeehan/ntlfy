description: Music to fall in love with, a calendar that doesn't fill you with a
  sense of dread, a kid's movie that everyone should see, a TV show that is
  definitely better than Game of Thrones.

  intro:
    jillian: I don’t have anything going on in my life that tops the fact that
      Summer graduated, let’s be real. I love her so much and I am so, so proud
      of her. [Now give her a job](https://summerfarah.glitch.me/).
    summer: I AM A GRADUAAAAAATEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! Slowly, piece by piece,
      each part of my identity has fallen away these past few weeks. Time to
      embrace my non-studentship.

    title01: St. Vincent’s MASSEDUCTION
    desc01: “New York” came as a suggested song on one of my sad-adjacent playlists
      recently and I just fell in love with [this whole
      album](https://open.spotify.com/album/4RoOGpdrgfiIUyv0kLaC4e) all over
      again. I have liked St. Vincent for a while, but felt like I never
      appreciated her to her fullest? This album fucking rocks, and wow, what a
      wonderful post-grad mood.

    title02: Detective Pikachu
    desc02: "[THIS MOVIE](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5884052/) IS SO GOOD. Ok,
      full disclosure: it is absolutely for its audience, and that audience is
      me and other children. However. Despite its target audience, Detective
      Pikachu respects what children are capable of handling, unlike other
      pieces of Pokemon media (the anime, sorry, I love it on principle, but).
      It’s not a dark & gritty reboot of all of the other things we liked in our
      youth, too, which is refreshing. Seeing Pokemon in real life is magical &
      I absolutely did cry real tears when a group of bulbasaur had their
      moment."

    title01: Cute-ify your calendar
    desc01: "First of all, if you’re not using a calendar app to schedule your
      entire life, what are you doing? Second of all, yes I am a Virgo rising.
      So here’s the thing: you are not required to use the default colors in
      whatever calendar app you’re using. You’re allowed to pick colors that are
      pleasing to look at and don’t fill you with a sense of dread every time
      you look at your schedule. Go through every calendar you have (I have 20+
      but that’s another story), figure out how to change the color of it (here
      are instructions for [Apple
      Calendar](https://support.apple.com/guide/calendar/change-a-calendars-nam\
      e-or-color-icl1030/mac) and [Google
      Calendar](https://www.cedarville.edu/insights/blog/change-color-of-google\
      -calendar.aspx)), and pick one that you like. My calendar is mostly light
      pinks and purples—highly recommend."

    title02: Veep
    desc02: Uhhhhhhh Game of Thrones who? Sorry but
      the [Veep](https://www.hbo.com/veep) finale is the only series finale I
      will accept. I’m going to miss Veep so much, but it truly couldn’t have
      gotten a better ending. If you want to watch a show that is brilliant and
      hilarious from start to finish, Veep is that show. I don’t have anything
      else to say about it, just please watch it. Trust me on this.
