  intro:
    topic: renewal
    jillian: I wouldn’t be happy with any of my work (or with myself, really) if I
      wasn’t constantly thinking about making changes and improvements, steadily
      moving forward and transforming. There’s just something about this time of
      year that amplifies that—back-to-school season has turned into Virgo
      season in adulthood, my birthday is around the corner, and I’ve already
      had my annual cold to mark the changing of seasons. I used to think I was
      afraid of change, but I think I was really just afraid of how much it
      excited me. You might notice this newsletter has a new look today—Substack
      gave us a good start, but we’ve decided to move over to Mailchimp so we
      can do bigger, better things. [Our
      Substack](https://letterstosummer.substack.com/) archives will stay up,
      but all of our future letters will live on our [brand new
      website](https://letterstosummer.com/). It’s the season of changes and
      renewal. Are you excited?
    summer: "I decided that adulthood would be marked by several things, one of the
      stranger ones being not racking up library fines. I’ve had fines at every
      library I’ve ever gotten books from, except elementary schools. I love the
      concept of libraries, as many do, but it’s been a long time since I’ve
      actually held love for a library instead of panic. I’m thankful my
      education did not totally destroy my positive relationship to reading, but
      it did alter how I feel in libraries; the sense of urgent productivity,
      the way your time with a book is not really yours when someone else needs
      it for research, etc etc etc. Now that I’ve moved, I’ve decided: new city,
      new rules. Read more, read wider, and use community resources. Jill and I
      do monthly goal check-ins together, and with her I established September
      as a reset. The most consistent habit I have is writing this newsletter,
      and I love it, but I need to do more for myself. October is for
      rediscovering healthy habits I let go of a long, long time ago."

    title01: Rilo Kiley’s The Execution of All Things
    desc01: Welcome to 2019, where sometimes you’ll be listening to St. Vincent and
      Spotify will be like *hey how about these related artists?* and it’s your
      usual rotation of sad girl music (Mitski, Lorde, Phoebe Bridgers) and then
      there’s an artist you haven’t heard before and it’s Rilo Kiley and you’re
      like *wow, that name sounds familiar* because they referenced this band
      on *Gilmore Girls* ALL OF THE TIME so you click on the full album and
      you’re getting ready for the day and “A Better Son/Daughter” plays and you
      just kind of stare at yourself in the mirror and cry because this is truly
      a soundtrack for the everyday morning struggle of inhabiting a body/being
      a person/existing with depression and all of those other little things
      that make navigating life difficult and it’s comforting to listen to
      something that feels very much a precursor for all of the music you like
      now and also something that’s kind of been present in your life as long as
      you’ve loved *Gilmore Girls*, too. [So that’s my
      recommendation](https://open.spotify.com/album/23EqcK0ZR1ravQaEsGpQyH).

    title02: Durga Chew-Bose’s review of Call Me By Your Name
    desc02: As a culture we probably don’t care too much about *Call My By Your
      Name* anymore, but it’s been on my mind this past week and so naturally,
      this [essay](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/first-impressions-luca-guadagninos-call-me-by-your-name) has
      been, too. I love Durga’s film writing so much and crave more of it and so
      I come back to this every few months to fill that need (and honestly, to
      study?). Her careful observations, like “\[CMBYN] delivers romantic
      tension as it enters a home. Not feverishly as one might expect, but
      slowly, as if each image is rising from memory,” capture exactly what
      continues to draw me to the movie—despite the obvious problematic
      aspects—and are definitely articulated and replicated in her writing
      style, too. My favorite reviews are ones that parallel their love for what
      they are discussing in the way that they write, and gentle yearning is one
      of my favorite feelings—put them together, and that’s a perfect read.

    title01: Ologies
    desc01: "[This](https://www.alieward.com/ologies/phenology) was the first
      episode of Ologies that I ever listened to, and I immediately fell in
      love. Some backstory: I met Alie Ward earlier this year when her CBS
      show [came to my
      office](https://blog.lickability.com/we-were-on-tv-281910f4b3b6) to film a
      segment, which was extremely cool. Then, a few weeks ago, she was on an
      episode of [Forever
      35](https://forever35podcast.com/home/2019/9/26/episode-91-alie-ward) whe\
      re she mentioned her science
      podcast, [Ologies](https://www.alieward.com/ologies). The first episode I
      listened to was about phenology, the study of seasons, and it made me feel
      so cozy and ready for fall. Alie has a way of taking a subject like
      phenology—a word I had never even heard before—and making it feel familiar
      and accessible. This episode starts out with questions like *“Why do
      leaves change color?”* and ends with a broader discussion about climate
      change, and it is fantastic from start to finish."

    title02: This article about newsletters
    desc02: Newsletters are great, and we love them. We’ve loved them for a long
      time, thanks to tools like Tinyletter and Buttondown and Substack that
      have made it easy for anyone to start their own newsletter. [This
      article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/10/substack-revue-email-newsletter-startups-tinyletter/599557/) by
      Kaitlyn Tiffany for *The Atlantic* gives a shout out to all of the people
      who were writing newsletters before venture capital decided it was cool.
      Once you’re finished reading this, go read that instead.
