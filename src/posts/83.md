  intro:
    topic: tea
    jillian: There is [an old Tumblr
      post](https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1381998653611638787?s=20&t=Gwv7A7MX4UVdGMXATrokFQ) I
      think about a lot that says “sometimes making tea is less about drinking
      it and more ab it keeping you company.” Every morning, I make a cup of
      tea—sometimes hot black tea, sometimes matcha, sometimes an iced chai—and
      it keeps me company whenever I need it. In the morning to start my day, in
      the afternoon when I need a boost, at night while I get ready for bed. It
      is a constant friend in my life and I’m grateful for it.
    summer: Leila Chatti has this really wonderful poem titled
      “[Tea](https://www.missourireview.com/leila-chatti-tea/),” that has the
      line “in my hands I hold / a warmth I make.” I think this really gets at
      the core of my relationship to tea—I drink it in the middle of the day
      when I need something comforting, drink it with breakfast when I am with
      my family, drink it when I am feeling any kind of under the weather and
      can’t handle coffee. I’m trying to get the energy to make a second cup,
      right now—I need to be warm!

    title01: Customs by Solmaz Sharif
    desc01: "[I reviewed this
      book](https://www.clereviewofbooks.com/home/solmaz-sharif-customs-review)!
      My first review this year, and probably one of my only—I wanted to take a
      step back from reviewing since I did it really ravenously last year, but
      the promise of getting to read one of my most-anticipated books a few
      months early…I couldn’t stand to wait, honestly. It was incredible, as
      expected, I’ve re-read it so many times already and god. Solmaz Sharif,
      greatest of all time. [Check it
      out](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781644450796)."

    title02: Brown Butter Miso Chocolate Chip Cookies
    desc02: I have been craving chocolate chip cookies lately and also am now on
      TikTok (lol), and I got a few videos of people making these cookies. I
      ended up using [this
      recipe](https://butternutbakeryblog.com/miso-chocolate-chip-cookies/), and
      HOLY shit dude they are SOOOOOOO yummy. The miso and browned butter were a
      little difficult to combine and I ended up having to chill the mixture
      until it became semi-solid again to properly mix, but after that there
      were no hitches! I would use a little less chocolate than is called for,
      too, but god. I ate so many the first night. There’s one left. I’m going
      to make more tomorrow and forever.

    title01: Spiritfarer
    desc01: I have been playing [this
      game](https://thunderlotusgames.com/spiritfarer/) extremely slowly—just
      enjoying the pretty skies and my endless little to-do list of giving hugs,
      catching fish, and visiting new islands. This week, I finally got to help
      one of the spirits I’ve been traveling with pass through the Everdoor, and
      it was so sad and beautiful and sweet. I’m in no rush to finish the game,
      because I like taking it slow and I like that it’s there for me when I
      need it, but I am very excited to meet and help new characters.

    title02: The Qi
    desc02: I think this might be the world’s prettiest tea. [The
      Qi](https://the-qi.com/) sells whole flowers—my favorite is the rose—that
      you can brew into a very nice herbal tea. It feels luxurious, like a
      little treat for myself. And it’s especially good right before bed when I
      want a warm, yummy drink.
