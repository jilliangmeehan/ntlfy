  intro:
    topic: digital communication
    jillian: "I’ve met most of my best friends on Tumblr and Twitter, so I’ve always
      been really comfortable communicating and building relationships online. I
      have a lot of feelings about the way I navigate social media based on the
      10+ years I’ve been doing it, I guess, and with that comes a lot of
      feelings about how I communicate with friends both privately and
      publicly—in DMs, in tweets, in group chats, in Discord servers, in text
      messages, and IRL. I think there’s a time and place for each of these, and
      it’s not even something that I can articulate very well, just something
      that feels instinctual to me. (A side effect of having so many
      communication channels: sometimes I find myself having three different
      conversations with a friend at the same time via three different apps.)
      Lately, I’ve been leaning into private, one-on-one conversations a little
      bit more—Summer took a small break from Twitter, so suddenly I had an
      excuse to spend all day texting her little updates about my life; and I
      met a friend to drink boba in the park over the weekend so we could catch
      up in person. Both felt really nice and really natural. There are so many
      ways to stay connected with people you care about online, and the thing is
      it doesn’t really matter how you do it as long as you…do it. I think
      that’s the point I wanted to make, who knows. Text your friends!"
    summer: "Sometimes I’m afraid I’m more charismatic online than I am in person. I
      have a lot of social anxiety, manifesting in both ends of the spectrum: I
      am kind of weird, quiet, hiding behind people I know, or I am overly
      energetic and obnoxious and feel like death when I am alone again. I’m
      embarrassed by what comes out of my mouth even if there is no reason to
      be. It is not that I am more cautious or filtered when I communicate
      through text, but something about my tone feels more confident. I barely
      know the voices of some of the people I trust the most in the world,
      because our communication has been always online. I’ve seen a slow
      reconsideration of friendships forged on the internet in the last few
      years and I think the pandemic has only reinforced how strong digital
      communication has the potential to be, if only you put work and effort
      into the relationships (like literally any relationship lol) formed
      through it. I love when my friends text me out of the blue and I love when
      people check up on me, I love stupid e-mails and IG DMs and anything
      people do to keep up and keep in touch."

    title01: how DRIVERS LICENSE by OLIVIA RODRIGO captures suburban sadness from
      Flash Thrive
    desc01: "Ok so I hadn’t actually heard [this
      song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmDBbnmKpqQ) before I watched [this
      video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MiF-xxt-Q0) essay and I only
      connected the dots that the Olivia Rodrigo people keep talking about is
      the girl in [High School Musical: The Musical: The
      Series](https://letterstosummer.com/31) like a week ago, and YET! This
      analysis made me cry? It probably has something to do with the fact that
      I’m back in the suburbs in my childhood home and cannot even drive, but
      anyway. Rosie’s video essays are the absolute best—if you care about
      Coming of Age 2010s aesthetics and where that all comes from, I highly
      recommend."

    title02: The Muppets (2011)
    desc02: A few weeks ago I asked my TL what is a movie that feels like *Mamma
      Mia!,* because I was sad and wanted that level of comfort but felt like
      watching something new. My friend Nico suggested *The Muppets* and it
      honestly was a top 5 decision of 2021. It’s silly and sweet and the music
      is great, a truly All Ages type of movie that does not condescend or
      resort to cheap humor. I cried? which is fine and normal, I don’t think
      there’s ever been a movie I didn’t cry at, but wow! It’s on Netflix,
      please go have fun.

    title01: The Uncanny Counter
    desc01: "I know that I am the kind of person who feels way too many feelings and
      loses her mind at every TV show. So, full disclosure, I basically
      recommend every TV show I’ve ever watched. And if I don’t, it’s because
      Summer already recommended it and that’s why I decided to watch it. All
      this to say: I recently finished the first season of [The Uncanny
      Counter](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&c\
      ad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjq1qiQ9ZLwAhV4MlkFHe2qC4UQFjAKegQIAhAD&url=https\
      %3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F81323551&usg=AOvVaw3aaBmQdFFqYVtEhPvjp\
      bZE) and it made me cry on several occasions and I love all of the
      characters and their amazing fits with my whole heart. My elevator pitch
      is that it’s like if the Grim Reaper was a very adorable high school boy
      with a found family and lots of good turtleneck/jacket combos."

    title02: Star projectors
    desc02: I got this a projector recently as part of my quest to make my bedroom
      as cozy as possible and it’s my new favorite thing. Every night, I turn it
      + a pink lamp on and light a candle in my bedroom, and it has become a
      10000x more fun and relaxing space. I didn’t do a ton of research, so
      there may be other star projectors out there that are better for you,
      but [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=pa_sp_atf_aps_sr_pg1_1?ie=UTF8&adId=A009563818FGV3586F8DY&url=%2FBlissLights-Sky-Lite-Projector-Ambiance%2Fdp%2FB07L8R5PK6%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fdchild%3D1%26keywords%3Dstar%2Bprojector%26qid%3D1619131053%26sr%3D8-2-spons%26psc%3D1&qualifier=1619131053&id=1180205478372372&widgetName=sp_atf) is
      the one I got.
