  intro:
    topic: going at your own pace
    jillian: I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed this week—not with my work or my
      to-do list, but with my media backlog. There are too many games I want to
      play, too many shows I want to watch, too many books I want to read, and
      not enough time. As much as I like keeping track of everything I’m in the
      middle of, I’ve started feeling bad about being in the middle of *too
      many* things. There are new games I want to play, but I feel like I can’t
      start them until I finish some of the ones I’m working on. But I’m having
      a hard time getting through any of the games I’m in the middle of because
      there are just so many of them that I can’t focus on any of them long
      enough to finish them! It’s a whole mess. This week, I’m trying to
      remember that it’s okay to take things slowly, go at your own pace, do
      things only when you’re in the mood for them. I want to worry less about
      “finishing” and more about enjoying myself.
    summer: I attended a virtual writing workshop last weekend, which was amazing! I
      love writing poetry (and reading it, as you know from this newsletter) but
      am generally pretty casual about it. Being in more formalized writing
      spaces is really fun and generative but can also give me a lot of imposter
      syndrome or anxiety about my work and the way it finds itself in the
      world. I’m not a super jealous person—I’m a big cheerleader!—but sometimes
      you can’t really help the *why am I not getting the things the people
      around me are?* thoughts from becoming overwhelming. I am a slow writer,
      good stuff coming out of me every few months and the urge to submit even
      less frequent—putting together a “book” feels like an impossible task, as
      by the time I have “enough” poems I don’t like the oldest ones anymore.
      I’m trying to be kind to myself though—there’s a pace we all go at, and my
      pace is fine. I’ll get to where I want/am supposed to be eventually.
      Scarcity is manufactured!

    title01: Laurel Hell
    desc01: I was despairing over what to recommend this week and when I finally sat
      down to write after a kind of hellish day, I realized I hadn’t recommended
      LAUREL HELL YET????? To be fair to myself, we’ve only had one newsletter
      since it dropped but my goodness! I have basically had it on repeat since
      that Thursday at 9PM PST. It is speculative excellence, it is eerie and
      painful and fun and everything I love so much about Mitski. Listen

      wherever you get music.

    title02: who is owed springtime by Rasha Abdulhadi
    desc02: I moderated a panel that my dear friend Rasha Abdulhadi was on the other
      day and was reminded of just how wonderful and brilliant they are—their
      recent chapbook, *who is owed springtime*, is gorgeous both as a Book of
      Poetry and also as an object (beautiful cover, perfect little trim size,
      soft pages, well laid-out interior). You can get a
      copy [here](https://www.neonhemlock.com/books/who-is-owed-springtime-by-rasha-abdulhadi).

    title01: Nico Neco Zakkaya
    desc01: I met up with a friend to go to this stationery story a few days ago
      after multiple people told me to check it out—and it’s so cute! I want to
      live there! It had so many beautiful stickers and notebooks and pens and
      stamps that I could hardly resist taking home with me. But it also had
      lots of things I didn’t expect to see, like candles and handmade bookmarks
      and wax seals. I bought some stickers and washi tape and a couple of
      stamps to tide me over until I can go back. If you live in NYC it’s
      definitely worth checking out, but they also have [an online
      store](https://www.niconeco.com/) if you can’t visit in person!

    title02: Do something just for you
    desc02: "This is something I’ve been trying to work on that I want to recommend
      to you, also: spend some time doing a hobby just for you, alone, with no
      intention of sharing the result with anyone else. It’s really easy for me
      to want to work on something like painting in the hopes that what I make
      will turn out good so I can post a picture of it online—and there’s
      nothing wrong with that! But I want to get better at painting just for
      myself, without worrying about how it’ll turn out, and without showing it
      to anyone else even if I’m proud of it. Maybe that’s something you can try
      too."
