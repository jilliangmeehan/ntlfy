  intro:
    topic: slowing down
    jillian: Lately, I have been trying to wake up just a little bit earlier, early
      enough that I am allowed to spend some extra time in bed with a cup of tea
      before I need to get up and get ready for work, early enough to have a
      little bit of breathing room. Maybe I spend that time reading, or watching
      the pigeons on my balcony, or playing a video game. (Did you know you
      could play video games in the morning before work? I certainly didn’t. But
      you can.) Maybe I spend that time just laying in bed, doing nothing. I am
      often in a rush, but not in the mornings—that is when I am allowed to slow
      down, take my time, and breathe. Just for an hour, but it’s my hour. And
      then I get out of bed, and I get ready for work. And the rest of the day
      comes fast.
    summer: "I’ve always been a fast reader. No one considered it a problem, and it
      didn’t become one until I was in my mid-teens, with my brain feeling bad
      more often than not. One thing depression took from me was comprehension
      and memory: I was absorbing less and less as I read, struggling more to
      remember what it had been that I spent an hour doing. It wasn’t until I
      was 19 or 20 that I really realized why, when I was in class assigned Jane
      Austen’s *Emma.* My professor emphasized that Austen deserved to be read
      slowly; I had read two Austen novels before and did not enjoy either of
      them, couldn’t really tell you what had happened and blamed the text. But
      I was a marginally obedient student and cared too much about my grades, so
      of course I read. And I read slowly, pushing against my instinct. And I
      enjoyed it. I still couldn’t tell you small details and did poorly on
      comprehension quizzes, but my experience was not marked by frustration and
      confusion which many of my reading experiences had become. I still
      struggle with instinct, the motivation to do the most, the feeling that
      I’m not a good reader if I’m not cycling through new books every few days.
      I want to keep slowing down, and keep giving words the time they deserve."

    title01: Helen Rosner Interviews Samin Nosrat
    desc01: "I love [this New Yorker
      piece](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/i-fail-\
      almost-every-day-an-interview-with-samin-nosrat) for a variety of reasons:
      Helen and Samin are two of my favorite people in the food world, the photo
      of Samin’s sink as she strains pickled beets, the conversation about
      depression, etc. The moment that struck me the most was Samin reflecting
      on writing
      a [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/dining/persian-food-recipes-\
      samin-nosrat.html) about Persian food for the NYT, then interjecting, “but
      then, well, it turns out that people can like our food and still want to
      bomb us.” You might have noticed, but talking about Palestinian food is
      one of my main hobbies: watching others (my mom, [that one BA
      video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGaf6yMtBF0)) make it, eating it,
      sharing it with my friends—that’s joy, that’s love. I know the people I
      share my food with already love me, and are already learning about the
      ways my people are harmed; this is not the case for every patron looking
      for shawarma. It’s beautiful to hope someone will taste zaatar and decide
      they’re ready to help free Palestine, but that’s an impossible pressure to
      place on cuisine. Not only will people eat our food and still bomb us,
      they’ll take it for their own and pretend we never existed in the first
      place. There are small ways to curb that, like not buying [certain hummus
      brands](http://bdslist.org/consumer/sabra-dipping-co-llc/), vetting
      “Mediterranean” restaurants before you go, and so on. Food can be a tool
      of justice, but never on its own."

    title02: Portrait of a Lady on Fire
    desc02: Portrait of a Lady on Fire, directed by Céline Sciamma, is perhaps the
      best romantic film I have ever seen. The subtle eye movements, the tense
      collarbones, the *yearning.* The absolute yearning, oh my god. This movie
      is a beautiful meditation on gaze, with the premise being a woman
      commissioned to paint a wedding portrait but not let the subject know she
      is painting her. And then (spoiler?) they fall in love. And it’s beautiful
      and tender and there were two scenes that made me cry and I still get
      goosebumps everywhere when I think about them. [Find it in a theater near

    title01: Turning off notifications
    desc01: There is nothing more annoying to me than trying to concentrate on
      reading an article or playing a game or watching a video on my phone and
      seeing a bunch of banner notifications pop up to distract me—so [I turned
      them off](https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1231070822074327042).
      I also turned off push notifications and badges for most of the apps on my
      phone, so I only get notified for things that *really* need my attention,
      like text messages and DMs. Spend some time curating your notification
      settings this week—you deserve a little more quiet.

    title02: Little Weirds by Jenny Slate
    desc02: I finished reading [Jenny Slate’s
      book](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316485340) a little over a week
      ago, but I have not stopped thinking about it. I miss reading it! It was
      full of nice, small passages that made me feel happy and gentle and
      tender. The way to read this book, in my opinion, is to wake up a little
      bit earlier than you need to and spend 5 minutes reading it until you feel
      good and soft and ready to get out of bed, and then carry that feeling
      with you for the rest of the day, like taking a daily multivitamin. I
      underlined so much of this book, but my one very favorite bit was
      this: **“My vulnerability is natural and permissible and beautiful to me,
      and it should remind you of your responsibility to behave like a friend to
      me and the world.”**
