  intro:
    topic: being tired
    jillian: Sometimes we have a really hard time coming up with a topic for this
      section of the newsletter; today was one of those days. I joked that we
      should just write “on being tired” and say something to the effect of, *we
      couldn’t think of anything, so here you go*. Turns out that wasn’t a joke,
      and this is really what you’re getting this week. I hope that you, if you
      are tired like we are, can find a few small things in your life to be
      grateful for and happy about to get you through the day.
    summer: Sometimes you are in such a low place you can’t even feign
      thoughtfulness and so here we are! On being tired. I stayed up really late
      last night without meaning to; I generally have sleep aids but have been
      without them for a few days. It hadn’t really mattered since my Day to Day
      had been pretty physically/emotionally exhausting, but my limit came. I
      regretted it this morning, I regret it now; Jill and I threw a few joke
      topics back and forth, she raised something we think we might have already
      written “on” before. Who knows? There are so many little thoughts in our
      heads, rolling around and marinating and waiting to wake up. I could let
      them, after a good night’s sleep, maybe.

    title01: Bellydancing on Wounds
    desc01: This is Mohammed El-Kurd’s spoken word album where each poem is
      accompanied by oud played by Clarissa Bitar. I’ve been listening to it
      nonstop during my move and the combination of beautiful instrumentals and
      fucking good poetry is really just the perfect combination to help me make
      it through all of my mess and stress. [Listen on

    title02: Born in A Second Language by Akosua Zimba Afiriyie-Hwedie
    desc02: I wrote a [formal
      review](https://vagabondcitylit.com/2021/07/19/in-review-born-in-a-second-language-by-akosua-zimba-afiriyie-hwedie/) of
      this poetry collection, but I just want to emphasize HOW MUCH I LOVED
      IT!!!! On my first read, I just kept snapping pictures and sending poems
      to people going “what the FUCK” — there was so much complexity and so much
      I feel unequipped to express, but wow. wow. Wow! Also Akosua is really
      nice and sent me sunflowers after my review went up and I just think you
      should all go [buy this

    title01: Scout
    desc01: New music
      from [Samia](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Uk1GyijF6fSfX4mWq5bfR?si=905800dd0c7d40a0)!
      Summer introduced me to Samia in this very newsletter, and this morning I
      listened to [her new
      EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/6gZWk2mfNHb7jxZhlGTBnQ?si=wzvc9zwhQEizBOcD0Gbl7w&dl_branch=1) and
      loved it. I especially liked the first song, As You Are (which Summer
      recommended in our recent bonus letter
      on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/letterstosummer) 👀), but I’m sure
      I’ll be listening to all of them a lot in the next few weeks.

    title02: Inside
    desc02: I hadn’t seen Bo Burnham’s
      newest [special](https://www.netflix.com/title/81289483) on Netflix yet
      when I went to go see it in theaters with a friend last weekend—even
      though everyone I knew was talking about how good it was, it just wasn’t a
      priority for me! But uh. It really was very good. When I got out of the
      theater, I immediately started listening to the album so I could hear all
      the songs again. And I haven’t really stopped thinking about it since. So
      if you somehow haven’t watched it yet, this is your sign! Do it!
