  intro:
    jillian: A few cool things I’ve been working on came out this week—[Summer’s
      website](https://summerfarah.glitch.me/) (which I love and am very happy
      with), and [this
      post](https://www.thethirlby.com/camp-thirlby-diary/2019/4/23/why-i-built-give-with-us-a-shopping-driven-donation-platform) I
      wrote for Camp Thirlby about why I started [Give with
      us](https://givewith.us/). Check them both out, maybe, if you want,
      please.
    summer: I’m literally losing it. But [I have a website
      now](https://summerfarah.glitch.me/)! Thank you, Jillo, I love you!

    title01: Songs that Make People Happy
    desc01: A month or so ago I had the realization that listening to Mitski was
      actually making me more depressed, if you can believe it! I turned to
      nostalgia & pop punk for a bit, but you can only scream along to Paramore
      for so many weeks before you just get sad about how Hayley Williams
      doesn’t get the credit she deserves. So, I asked folks on Instagram to
      send me songs that make them happy. [This
      playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/summabis/playlist/33dHTK9t9G7s76t57EaUTC?si=rNR9z_cdSS6t9KIPNDf2yQ) is
      the result of that. There are also a few songs on there that weren’t
      recommendations from other people, try to guess which ones! I appreciate
      everyone who sent me a song—minus my cousin and friend who sent in “Baby
      Shark” because that’s ridiculous—my body will fight immense anxiety &
      depression another day because of you.

    title02: Arab American Poetry
    desc02: It’s been a while (?) since I’ve given a literary recommendation,
      so [here’s a giant thread of poems by Arab
      Americans](https://twitter.com/LKTuffaha/status/1115655673449029632) to
      celebrate National Poetry Month AND Arab American Heritage Month! Lena
      Khalaf Tuffaha, a poet I love dearly, has been posting a poem every day by
      a different Arab American. Follow her for poems & archive!!!!

    title01: Samin’s focaccia recipe
    desc01: I have never made focaccia before, but last week I watched [that Bon
      Appetit video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQOhAeNAjKc) where Brad
      makes focaccia with Samin Nosrat and I was like, “Oh I need to try that.”
      Turns out it is not that hard to make! (As long as you have 14 hours to
      let the dough ferment before you bake it.) I made it last weekend for
      Easter using [Samin’s
      recipe](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/fat/ligurian-focaccia) and it
      tasted amazing, thank you very much.

    title02: Keap candle subscription
    desc02: I wish I had enough self control not to spend lots of money on candles,
      but I do not, unfortunately. I like fancy candles, and I like to burn
      through them very fast by lighting them every single night. It’s a curse!
      Anyway, [this candle subscription service](https://www.keapbk.com/) is
      perfect for me (and maybe you, if your brain is broken like mine is)—a new
      candle every month!!!! And I don’t even have to think about it!!!! I love
      it. End of story.
