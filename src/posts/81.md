  intro:
    topic: quitting
    jillian: I gave a talk at [Wavelength](https://wavelengthconf.com/) last year
      called “Why you should quit your hobbies.” It’s something that I have a
      lot of feelings about—the fact that knowing when to take a break from or
      quit something is good and healthy, and that quitting doesn’t mean you’re
      a failure or a bad person, and that it’s okay to let go of things to make
      room in your life for other things. I’ve had a lot of things in my life
      that I’ve loved and eventually walked away from, and I feel good about
      that. As fun and cool as it is to have a bunch of creative passions and
      side projects and hobbies, it’s also very easy to get overwhelmed by them,
      to lose interest in them, and to even move onto other things—and that’s
      fine!!!
    summer: I’m bad at saying no and I become loyal to things and people very
      quickly. This is definitely leads to over-commitment; sometimes I create
      more responsibilities for myself and sometimes all of the opportunities
      just come in at once. This month is definitely a difficult one—every time
      I finish one thing, there’s another on deck, and I really just want to
      play video games. It’s months like this that make me re-evaluate my
      priorities. I’m thinking about the waves of relief that have washed over
      me throughout the years after leaving something that was voluntary and no
      longer fulfilling. Jill and I closed our Patreon, which wasn’t necessarily
      a relief, but we did it before it became a problem. That’s good, that’s
      healthy; we are adults, we can leave when we want to. I need to remind
      myself of that more.

    title01: The Charm Offensive by Alison Cochrun
    desc01: Sometimes Goodreads is a useful social platform—I saw a friend from
      college had read this book and rated it highly so I put a library hold on
      it. 12 weeks of waiting later, I finished it IN ONE SITTING. Phew! I love
      romcoms, especially in book form, and the tropes this one follows are
      especially delicious; it takes place on the set of a Bachelor-esque show
      and the contestant falls in love with his producer. It’s like that show,
      Unreal, but gay! Woohoo! Get it from the library, or buy it
      on [bookshop](https://bookshop.org/books/the-charm-offensive/9781982170714).

    title02: Invincible
    desc02: I haven’t finished this show yet, but oh my GOD! It’s so good! My
      roommate recommended it to me and I am in awe I hadn’t heard of it before.
      It’s an animated show superhero-critique show; it’s very successful in its
      allegory of power and colonialism, but I do not want to give much
      away—it’s
      on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/INVINCIBLE-SEASON-1/dp/B08WJMRHYZ).

    title01: "Pokemon Legends: Arceus"
    desc01: I was going to be good and wait a while before buying [this
      game](https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/), but the morning it came out I
      saw so many people playing it and it looked so cute that I had to get it
      immediately—and I don’t regret it! I’m making my way through the story
      slowly, mostly spending time exploring the world and trying to get one of
      each Eeveelution. It feels like a really fun and exciting new way to enjoy
      Pokemon, and I definitely recommend trying it whether you’re new to the
      franchise or not.

    title02: Stream Deck
    desc02: I got a [new toy](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) for my desk,
      oops. I had been using the [Stream Deck
      app](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mobile) on my iPad for a while
      to do stuff like mute and unmute my mic, but it wasn’t until recently that
      I decided to upgrade to the “real” version and try out different plugins
      and see what kinds of other stuff I could use it for. I’m having a lot of
      fun with it so far! Using it for streaming is definitely helpful, but I
      like being able to use it for other work stuff, too.
