  intro:
    jillian: July has been a super busy (but motivating!) month for me. I just
      launched a redesign of [Give with us](https://givewith.us/), my donation
      site. I made a lot of solid progress
      on [SNAX](https://www.instagram.com/snaxreport/), my upcoming zine about
      snacks. And I’m hosting a lil event at Mejuri in NYC in a few weeks—[come
      hang](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/mejuri-shopping-night-with-jilliangmeehan-tickets-64386277088)!
    summer: Drafting this on my phone for the first time! I am in Colorado for a
      wedding and am surrounded by beautiful friends I never get to see.

    title01: On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong
    desc01: I saw Ocean Vuong speak about [this
      book](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600633/on-earth-were-briefly-gorgeous-by-ocean-vuong/9780525562023/) about
      a month ago, specifically about the legacy of the American novel and what
      it means to join that tradition as a queer person of color. It was
      inspiring & he is the smartest person ever & this book made me cry deeply
      but is also just so masterfully crafted & honestly all novels should be
      giant prose poems!

    title02: White pesto pasta
    desc02: I’ve made [BA’s White Pesto
      Pasta](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/white-pesto-pasta) recipe twice
      now and I can say that it’s probably one of my favorite things to make!
      Chopping walnuts is meditative and there is something so wonderfully
      soothing about watching all of the ingredients emulsify together with the
      pasta at the end. It’s really, really yummy—make sure you add lemon juice,
      though, since the recipe doesn’t call for it (just zest). Lemon-y flavors
      make all food better.

    title01: Cute keyboards
    desc01: A month ago, I didn’t know anything about mechanical keyboards. Then I
      came across [DSA Magic
      Girl](https://www.notion.so/DSA-Magic-Girl-Is-it-November-yet-253ecdba4f14481c8343e071274ea86c),
      a group buy for an extremely cute, Sailor Moon-inspired keyset. Those keys
      aren’t available anymore (mine will ship in a few months!) but I recommend
      clicking that link if you’re at all interested in getting into mechanical
      keyboards but have no idea where to start. After a few weeks of a lot of
      googling, I ended up with [this
      cutie](https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1154107080305008641) on
      my desk, and I love it. Big thanks to [KBDFans](https://kbdfans.com/) and
      my boyfriend, Dylan, for teaching me everything I (barely) know.

    title02: Strawberry ice cream
    desc02: Specifically, [Van
      Leeuwen’s](https://vanleeuwenicecream.com/) strawberry ice cream. As a
      kid, I never really liked strawberries, and especially not strawberry ice
      cream—but now I can’t get enough. I buy this by the pint at my local
      grocery store and it’s my new favorite late-night snack.
