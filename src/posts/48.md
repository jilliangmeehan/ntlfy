  intro:
    topic: process
    jillian: We’ve talked about [routines](https://letterstosummer.com/24) before in
      this newsletter, about the comfort of having them and noticing them. I
      think about my own routines a lot—the big ones, like the things I do every
      morning to get ready for the day or every evening to get ready for bed;
      and the small ones, like the way I approach certain tasks at work or the
      way I write this newsletter every week. Starting to quarantine and work
      from home this year shook a lot of those processes up, and I struggled for
      months to feel even somewhat stable again. I had a hard time figuring out
      how to change my daily habits to fit a different environment. I think now,
      after two seasons have come and gone, I’m starting to feel like I’m on
      solid ground again. And I think a lot of that is because of those
      repetitive tasks that I find so much comfort in, like making a cup of tea
      every morning.
    summer: I’m trying to write again. This newsletter has been my main creative
      outlet for over a year; basically, since I finished college, I’ve been
      struggling with working on anything at all. There have been small projects
      here and there, but these past few weeks I’ve finally remembered what
      creative energy feels like, despite struggling with some other Life
      things. I’m trying to re-learn a writing process; how much time do I spend
      with my references, how much time do I spend editing, how much time do I
      spend thinking? I want to get comfortable with my approaches and have a
      true *method* for getting work done and doing what I want to do. I’m not
      good at routines or habits or any personal organizational things at all,
      but I think *process* is within my grasp.

    title01: Xiao Mei Brown Sugar Boba Ice Cream Bars
    desc01: My roommate was [buying boxes of
      these](https://fresh.hmart.com/media/catalog/product/cache/4a29384b44aa82bd9906cfa705b6f349/3/3/3323002181.png) for
      a good few weeks and god, they’re just the most amazing ice cream I’ve
      ever had. The texture was ridiculous—the creamiest ice cream but with
      little boba bits in it for the loveliest chew. The caramelization on the
      sugar is perfect. They made me feel like shit and I didn’t even care!
      You’ll probably have to go to Chinatown or an Asian grocery store to get
      them, but if it’s out of your way, I promise it’s worth it.

    title02: High Fidelity on Hulu
    desc02: Sorry to recommend a show that’s been cancelled, but I just sped through
      the first and only season of [High
      Fidelity](https://www.hulu.com/series/high-fidelity-52cb09be-ccc9-4eb4-9db8-f00b0443b2f5) and
      whew! It was so good! I had tried it a few weeks ago and couldn’t get
      through the first five minutes but after giving it another chance, oh my
      god. Zoe Kravitz is really fun to watch, but the side characters are even
      better—the record store setting works really well, and what may be another
      show’s entire premise only serves as a hint of a formula for one story
      (revisiting exes), giving space for a lot of fun with format within the
      fourth-wall-breaking moments. Maybe someone else will give us the S2 we
      deserve.

    title01: Duolingo
    desc01: I’m working on replacing some of my social media usage with other, less
      doomscroll-y apps, and [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is my recent
      favorite. I’ve been on and off Duolingo for years to practice my extremely
      mediocre French, but this time I decided to try learning a new language
      entirely from scratch, just for fun. (Turns out it is, in fact, a lot of
      fun.) So I’m learning Mandarin now! I think Duolingo is a good way to get
      started with learning a language whether you want to be fluent or you just
      want to pick up a few phrases, but it’s *definitely* a good way to do the
      latter. It’s also, in my case, a really productive way to stay off
      Twitter.

    title02: Computecuter
    desc02: "[@sailorhg](https://www.twitter.com/sailorhg) put together [this really
      nice website](https://computecuter.com/) full of recommendations for cute
      text editor themes, monospaced fonts, and mechanical keyboard parts. All
      the stuff you need to make your computer cute! I love this and the little
      community of people online dedicated to making tech spaces cuter—we need
      even more of it, imo."
