  intro:
    topic: video games
    jillian: "Most mornings, in between making my first cup of tea of the day and
      sitting at my desk to work, I play Animal Crossing in bed to ease myself
      awake. I go through my daily chores in the game (watering my flowers,
      digging up fossils, talking to my neighbors, checking the shops) before
      I’m ready to tackle my daily chores in real life. Once I finish working
      for the day, I’m eager to return to my students in Fire Emblem Three
      Houses (which [Summer recommended in this
      newsletter](https://letterstosummer.com/21) before I was ready to hear
      it). And all the moments in between, I spend plenty of time watching
      Twitch streams, liking tweets about Breath of the Wild, and sending Summer
      way too many Discord messages about the games we’re playing. I’d like to
      say something here about how video games are a place to “find solace” in
      these “unprecedented” and “trying” times, whatever that means. Instead, I
      will point you to two essays that I keep returning to that say it better
      than I can: [“Video Games Are a To-Do List That You
      Play”](https://www.thecut.com/2020/02/video-games-are-a-to-do-list-you-pl\
      ay.html) is required reading to understand me, and [Alanna Okun’s recent
      piece](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/5/12/21241735/nintendo-switch-a\
      nimal-crossing-video-games-coronavirus-quarantine) about playing video
      games in quarantine hit me especially hard. Here’s a quote from the
      latter: “I want a place that’s not here, a set of problems that aren’t
      these, something I can talk about with my friends and co-workers and
      strangers that isn’t going to claw me apart with anxiety.”"
    summer: It’s been just a year since I graduated college, which means it’s been
      just a year since a month-long period began in which I did very little
      each day besides play Breath of the Wild. I was so exhaused. I was getting
      sicker each day, from some mysterious dust in my apartment (I’m ok now, I
      use my inhaler and everything). I was anxiously waiting to hear back from
      a few jobs but had no energy to apply to others. Really, there was nothing
      else for me besides playing. The only major story point I had left was to
      defeat Ganon. And for a month, I didn’t; instead, I wandered. I felt too
      scared to fight the last battle without a friend with me. I’m not trying
      to make this into some sort of grand metaphor about how I wasn’t ready to
      move onto the next phase of my life in the interim of graduating and an
      office job, but the wandering in Breath of the Wild helped soothe my
      anxiety about urgency; the big things could wait, and handling the…side
      quests of life?…was valid, for now. There isn’t a time in my life in which
      video games did not assist that urgency to do More, and there isn’t a time
      in which video games didn’t improve other aspects of my life. Games made
      my brother and I have a good relationship, helped me make friends, and
      continue to help me come down from stressful events. Jill and I talk about
      video games basically every day, and like her, Animal Crossing is part of
      my morning routine—it was part of my morning routine when I was eight,
      too, and when I was fourteen, when there was no pandemic and I just
      carried general anxiety and stress about the world. It’s a constant that’s
      not actually a constant. And I need it! I love video games. Always have
      and always will.

    title01: Sex and the City
    desc01: Sex and the City is under the “comfort viewing” section on HBO. I
      thought I was tuning into an adult Gossip Girl*,* dealing with the
      absolutely bonkers stakes rich people create for themselves but instead
      it’s actually? Comfortable? Oh to go to brunch with your friends, oh to
      walk the New York streets at night in your $400 shoes, oh to be part of a
      campy group of friends that are archetypal yet fleshed out. The disconnect
      from my actual life—Carrie mentions meeting Mr. Big at 9 o’clock to which
      I said *god that’s so late,* to my boyfriend’s amusement—is just strong
      enough to not remind me that I can’t drink wine and laugh with my friends
      without a computer screen. Normally I don’t recommend something I haven’t
      finished, but I’m flying through season 2, and having a very good time.

    title02: Carly Rae Jepsen’s Dedication Side B
    desc02: "I woke up pretty sad this morning and guess what! Carly helped! We love
      a complex album that tracks a relationship and mixes the upbeat with the
      sad! I’m still in my initial listens, but as someone who got into CRJ
      relatively late—this is my suggestion to you: go have fun! [Go to
      Spotify!](https://open.spotify.com/album/7oHKKCXCFIv3J1Yh5F08pu)"

    title01: Cleaning your desk
    desc01: "I did not have the greatest week, to be honest. A bad combination of
      PMS and anxiety left me feeling absolutely horrible for a few days, and
      while I’m still not feeling great, I did manage to take advantage of a
      slight burst of energy to clean off some of the clutter on my desk and
      rearrange things in a way that’s making my brain feel a little bit better.
      I replaced the haphazard piles of sticky notes with a daily planner! I
      moved anything I don’t use on a daily basis out of sight! The thing is:
      cleaning up your workspace is not a perfect, permanent solution to any of
      the bad stuff, but it’s probably one of the only things in your control
      right now, so it definitely doesn’t hurt."

    title02: Rebecca Solnit on hope
    desc02: One of the most comforting things I’ve read so far during all this
      is [Rebecca Solnit’s
      essay](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-coronavirus-can-teach-us-about-hope-rebecca-solnit) in
      The Guardian about *what the coronavirus can teach us about hope.* I
      suggest you read it, too. And when you’ve finished that and want some
      more, you can read her book [Hope in the
      Dark](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781608465767), which explores how
      hope and human compassion can be catalysts for change in moments like
      this.
