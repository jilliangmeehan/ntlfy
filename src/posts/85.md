  intro:
    topic: obsessions
    jillian: Lately, I’ve been having a hard time getting through an entire day
      without spending a reasonable chunk of time thinking about either Fire
      Emblem or SK8 the Infinity. Luckily, Summer is in pretty much the exact
      same boat, so we always have each other to talk to about our passions.
      But! I won’t lie—I would love to have the ability to neatly put my
      thoughts and feelings about video games and anime into a little box and
      open it up only when appropriate. It’s not easy to be productive on a
      Monday morning when all you can think about is the Sylvain Gautier bag.
      That said, I guess if I had to choose between never loving anything and
      never being distracted by the things I love, I’d choose the latter. It
      feels good, if sometimes distracting, to be so into something that it’s
      all you can think about.
    summer: I’m currently going on over a week of some really awful body pains. I’ve
      been doing my best to manage, but it gets to a point where it’s all I can
      think about–which isn’t super helpful when it is likely aggravated by
      stress! I’ve always struggled to control my thinking, whether it’s good or
      bad. I remember being so fixated on Ouran High School Host Club that it
      felt painful when I couldn’t load my little YouTube episodes. I’m not
      super sure what that says about me? Anyway. I do love my little fixations,
      though. Waking up to FE3H texts from Jill & always being able to fall back
      into one of the many worlds I adore at the drop of a hat is prettty nice.

    title01: Casual Conversation by Renia White
    desc01: "[This](https://www.boaeditions.org/products/casual-conversation) was a
      great poetry collection! I’d been looking forward to it since reading the
      poem that was part of the contest-announcement (this book is part of the
      BOA series that Aracelis Girmay edits), and my goodness! It is an absolute
      delight. There is an incredible warmth that is present in these poems,
      even when the subject is more intense — each poem is so grounded,
      confident. Highly recommend."

    title02: Reading Etel Adnan
    desc02: My friend sent me [this
      playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1iuLvEdNJYwR9u5OeM1DSD?si=RB1wpRPwTeGGxQdiBXuOiw&utm_source=copy-link) many
      months ago; it has really pretty/eerie/weird instrumental music on it and
      feels exactly like reading an Etel Adnan book! I listen to it while I
      write, while I read, and when I just kinda wanna feel a vague sense of
      unsettlement.

    title01: SK8 the Infinity
    desc01: Summer and I both watched [this
      anime](https://www.funimation.com/shows/sk8-the-infinity/) for the first
      time recently and we’ve spent *a lot* of time talking about it together.
      It’s a very good, very fun show about extremely unrealistic skateboarding
      and I kind of can’t stop thinking about it. If you’re looking for
      something quick and lighthearted to watch, I very much recommend watching
      the first season—and I’m eagerly awaiting the second one.

    title02: "The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf"
    desc02: After watching all of [The Witcher](https://letterstosummer.com/79/) on
      Netflix and starting to play Witcher 3, I obviously was feeling very
      starved for Geralt of Rivia content. [This animated
      movie](https://www.netflix.com/title/81037868) is, I think, a good
      introduction to the story outside of the Netflix series for people who
      want more Witcher lore—it follows the life of Vesemir, how he became a
      witcher, and what happened before he became like a father figure to
      Geralt. Also, it made me cry.
