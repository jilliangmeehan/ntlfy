  intro:
    jillian: What a year this month has been! I’ve been fairly busy (and fairly
      stressed) recently, and I’m trying to remember to take care of myself and
      be grateful for everything in my life, but (!!!) sometimes that’s really
      hard to do—you know that feeling? Sometimes it just feels easier to lean
      into the stress of schedules and to-do lists and deadlines until it eats
      you entirely.
    summer: Hello from Los Angeles! I am traveling again, spending the week writing
      poems with my lovely lovely Arab American writing community. I’ve met so
      many wonderful people and feel very held, very warm. I am so thankful.

    title01: Hard Damage by Aria Aber
    desc01: This book made me lose my shit! It was my first for
      the [\#SealeyChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/sealeychallenge) (reading
      a book of poetry every day for the month of August, a challenge I have not
      managed to keep up with) and wow did it get my month off to a good start.
      Aria’s poetry is masterful and riddles my insides. You can order
      it [here](https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/university-of-nebraska-press/9781496215703/).

    title02: Jupiter Ascending
    desc02: THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES. Every beautiful space fantasy you can
      think of comes true. Mila Kunis gets beautiful outfits, Channing Tatum is
      a wolf-man (?), bees are your friend—if you are royalty. It’s
      on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/bl/title/70301367) now, so please
      join me in rewatching this messy, messy mess of a film over and over and
      over again.

    title01: A Short Hike
    desc01: This really cute, calming [indie game](http://ashorthike.com/) just came
      out recently and I downloaded it almost immediately—a very good call on my
      part. You play as a bird hiking up a mountain, talking to strangers, and
      finding treasure. It’s the kind of game that I want to play every night
      before I go to bed because it’s so soothing.

    title02: Tie dye
    desc02: "Two things that are true: tie dye is cool again, and making things with
      your hands is the best stress relief that exists. Last weekend, I got up
      on Saturday morning and [dyed a few of my
      socks](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1B2_jJlL7R/). On Sunday, I dyed one of
      my t-shirts. In between a packed schedule and overwhelming to-do list,
      taking time to do something creative with my hands made me feel *so* good.
      Step one: get a tie dye kit from a local craft store (or anywhere online).
      Step two: find a bunch of stuff you already own that you want to dye
      (socks, old white t-shirts, pillowcases, etc). Step three: do the thing."
