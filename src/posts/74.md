  intro:
    topic: creative process
    jillian: I donâ€™t really know what my creative process is these daysâ€”maybe
      because I donâ€™t have one? Or because Iâ€™m not trying to have one? Maybe
      because I donâ€™t really know what Iâ€™m trying to do creatively at all. Iâ€™m
      trying to set less creative goals for myself in favor of just trying
      things out and seeing what feels right. I could try to make a habit of
      writing for 5 minutes every day, or I could justâ€¦write when I feel like
      it. I could try to dedicate time to learning how to paint better, or I
      could let myself spontaneously break out my watercolor set whenever Iâ€™m in
      the mood and paint whatever feels good. My creative process, if I have
      one, is to have no process at all. Itâ€™s to wake up and see how Iâ€™m feeling
      and do what I want when I want to do it and not worry so much about the
      outcome as long as Iâ€™m enjoying myself.
    summer: "I wrote an artist statement for the first time as part of an
      application the other day and it was really weird to think concretely
      about my work, what my aims are, and what the art I produce
      actuallyÂ *looks*Â like. Third grade was the first time I had a sort of
      formal creative-writing education (loosely)â€”we were all given composition
      notebooks and told to split them into two sections: 1. brainstorming 2.
      actual drafts. For assignments, we always had to brainstorm first â€” these
      took form as associative bubbles or lists or outlines, and then we moved
      the formal writing to the draft section. After we finished our assignment,
      we could do whatever we wanted like work on other homework, read, or write
      moreâ€”I almost always chose write more, but I never used the brainstorm
      section for the non-assignment writing. I liked to justÂ *dive in.*Â My
      process was whatever chaos was falling out of my little child brain,
      whether it was logs of my Animal Crossing progress or Nancy Drew
      knock-offs. I think I still work in that way; lines and ideas come in the
      form of an obsessiveÂ *I gotta think this through right now or never
      again*Â type of way and I perform my creative work in bursts. Itâ€™s
      definitely not efficient, but hey! Iâ€™m just here to have fun."

    title01: Libby
    desc01: As someone who has a fine at every library Iâ€™ve ever had a card from,
      reading eBooks throughÂ [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/)Â has
      been really helpful in managing my book-buying and my tendency to not
      return things on time because of all of the bad brain things that keep me
      inside. I know not everyone is a fan of eBooksâ€”I still buy poetry
      booksâ€”but I just love the ease and access. You can have multiple library
      cards logged in, too!

    title02: I didnâ€™t know how to write about my sisterâ€™s deathâ€”so I had AI do it
      for me.
    desc02: Rest in peace, Believer Magazine! I love this publication and had hoped
      to write for it one day, but like many good things on the internet, soon
      it will be no more. My roommate linkedÂ [this incredible
      piece](https://believermag.com/ghosts/)Â by Vauhini Vara yesterday,
      andÂ *holy shit.*Â I love when online publications unitilize their
      online-ness in the presentation of pieces; the way this essay unfolds is
      as haunting as the content it contains. A really gorgeous rumination on
      death and technology, a harrowing application of AI.

    title01: Fruits Basket
    desc01: I just finished watching the newest version ofÂ [this
      anime](https://www.crunchyroll.com/fruits-basket)Â and I loved it so, so
      much. I also cried so, so much. I know someone who refuses to watch the
      last episode because she doesnâ€™t want it to end, and I completely
      relateâ€”it was such a beautiful, comforting story to wrap myself up in even
      when it was dark and devastating.

      best shows on television right now. Itâ€™s that good!!! It really is!!! Itâ€™s
      so funny and well-made all around, and there is truly not a single tiny
      thing I donâ€™t love about it. Iâ€™ve been looking forward to season three so
      much, and now that itâ€™s here, every Sunday night is reserved exclusively
      for eating pasta and watching new episodes."
