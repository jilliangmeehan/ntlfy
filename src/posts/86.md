  intro:
    topic: doing whatever we want
    jillian: When we started writing this newsletter (years ago, somehow!) I was
      really serious about staying on schedule and not skipping letters because
      I was way too used to starting new projects and abandoning them—and I
      didn’t want to do that with this. I wanted Letters to Summer to keep me in
      check, hold me accountable for writing and working on something every
      other week for as long as I could. Having a partner like Summer helped a
      lot with that. Since we started the newsletter, we *have* had to skip
      letters, we’ve sent *plenty* of letters out late (this one was supposed to
      go out last Friday, sorry!!!), and we’ve changed our schedule to better
      accommodate our capacity for making stuff. I don’t have the same fear that
      I did when we started. We’ve sent out over 80 newsletters—I’m not worried
      about our ability to keep going, even if we take breaks, even if we stray
      from our schedule. This project isn’t about staying accountable anymore;
      it’s about continuing to work on something together because it’s fun and
      we enjoy it. So if there are days it’s a little bit harder for us to do
      the work, it’s all good. We’ll do it when we want to.
    summer: This newsletter used to look a little different. It’s always had the
      same staples—two recommendations from each of us, a Tweet, but the “on”
      section used to just be little random updates. We used to use Substack! We
      used to send it out on Wednesdays? Now Fridays? RIP Patreon! I’m writing
      this on Saturday after we forgot two weeks in a row to send it out. This
      project is about flexibility—the low-stress way to encourage each other to
      keep up with the practice of writing, to remember the little things that
      kept us alive for the past two weeks, and most importantly to only do what
      feels good. I’ve had my fair share of control-related breakdowns over the
      years, exacerbated by the pandemic. Productivity leaks through into every
      part of my life, so even when I’m doing something fun, I find a way to
      make myself feel bad about it (despite actively working to not do this!).
      But with this project, there’s another person there to remind me *we can
      literally do whatever we want!*

    title01: Longing and Other Heirlooms by Arati Warrier and Sagaree Jain
    desc01: This is a very special chapbook!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Arati was my CUPSI
      coach/beloved mentor/current friend and Sagaree is a kindred spirit; they
      wrote this book together and it is so, so lovely and good. I’ve only read
      a few co-written chapbooks but I’m always in awe? This one is structured
      by similar poems on variation, with each narrative bleeding so well into
      the next—it never feels repetitive or jarring, rather incredibly cohesive.
      I think this is hard to do even when every poem is by the same person;
      there’s fun to be had in a cowritten chapbook, too, in thinking about
      authorship and voice—who is the primary storyteller in each moment? which
      details belong to who and where do those details repeat? Highly recommend;

    title02: Kirby and the Forgotten Land
    desc02: "[This](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/kirby-and-the-forgotten\
      -land-switch/) is the cutest game in the world!!!!! My brother and I
      played it co-op all of the way through which only made it cuter! I wish
      more Nintendo games had been co-op when we were children but now we can
      make up for it. Even though most Nintendo games are good for 7+, this one
      feels like it skews a little younger; it was easy (probably easier because
      of the co-op) and sweet and well-paced. And the ending was absolutely
      ridiculous. I had a blast! Now we are on to post-game. Nothing better than
      3D Kirby!!!!!! Free him from sidescrollers!!!!!!!!!!!"

    title01: Image2icon
    desc01: "I recently got fed up with the Spotify icon on my Mac not matching the
      shape of all my other Big Sur icons, so I wanted to make my own. I
      used [this app](https://img2icnsapp.com/), which makes it very very
      ridiculously easy to make custom folders and icons for various purposes.
      You can upload your own image to use, or you can type in a word or emoji
      and just pick a background color to keep it simple. If you’re the kind of
      person who has (or wants to have) a cute, themed Home Screen on your phone
      with widgets and shortcuts, this app is probably for you. (And if you
      don’t know how to change an app icon or folder on your Mac: right click →
      “Get info” → copy and paste the image you want to use onto the existing
      icon.)"

    title02: Spotify group sessions
    desc02: All day, I’ve been listening to TXT with my friend who lives six hours
      away while we both cleaned our apartments. Every once in a while we’d
      message each other something like “this song makes me go stupid” or “this
      album has NO MISSES”—like we were driving around together listening to an
      absurd playlist. The magic of [Spotify group
      sessions](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/group-session/)! There’s
      something very comforting to me about knowing that my friends and I are
      listening to the same music at the same time as we go about our days.
