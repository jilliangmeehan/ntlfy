  intro:
    topic: goals
    jillian: Sometime last year, Summer and another friend and I started a monthly
      email thread to plan and talk about our goals for the coming month,
      followed by the occasional video chat for progress updates. We talked
      about things we wanted to accomplish in our careers, in our personal
      lives, and in our relationships, but we also talked about our feelings,
      our anxieties, the things we’re grateful for, and the things we need help
      with. What started as a way to voice our goals and desires and to hold
      each other accountable became a pleasant excuse to catch up with each
      other and just *talk*. And I really can’t overstate how nice that is. We
      have recommended several methods for setting and tracking goals in this
      newsletter—including [a habit-tracking
      app](https://letterstosummer.com/6), a [goal-tracking
      spreadsheet](https://letterstosummer.com/4), a [workbook for setting
      yearly goals](https://letterstosummer.com/27), and the app mentioned
      below—but this is the only one that encourages community with people you
      love.
    summer: Every year, Oscars season approaches, and I tell myself *I will watch
      every film nominated for Best Picture.* Sometimes I’ve already seen a
      handful in theaters, some years I haven’t seen any at all. This year was
      less than more, from a combination of disinterest, snubs, and general
      anxiety at being in Public and Seen. The best I did, before this year, was
      2015 when torrenting was my friend (but of course I don’t do that anymore;
      I’m very cool and lawful). I’m not sure why I love awards shows, but I
      have since even before I loved to be mad online and wasn’t familiar with
      any material being awarded. I watched 15 hours of movies from
      Wednesday–Sunday, while still keeping my room relatively clean and putting
      together a viewing party with my roommate. I still didn’t see all of the
      Best Picture nominations, but I was satisfied with my breadth. I set a lot
      of goals for personal and professional development—many that I do not
      meet—but it’s fun to make something very *arbitrary,* like a quota of
      movies, and to achieve it. Goal-setting can be fun. There can be enough
      time if I make enough time.

    title01: Pain & Glory
    desc01: This was part of my Oscars binge, one of the films nominated for Best
      International Picture—and Antonio Banderas for Best Actor. Folks! Do you
      ever watch 14 hours of film directed by straight men and get exhausted,
      think all movies are just too long, wonder when directors stopped
      listening to their editors, triggering an existential spiral? And then you
      watch *Pain & Glory,* and you are healed? I highly recommend watching this
      even without the saturation of indulgence beforehand. Antonio Banderas is
      so good, especially when I realized his most notable role for me is, in
      fact, *Spy Kids.* The story follows an aging queer director, reflecting on
      his past and contending with his present. It is extremely tender, generous
      with time, and just *beautiful.* Again, healed. Check it out, hopefully in
      a theater near you!

    title02: "Birds of Prey: The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"
    desc02: "Sorry, I’m recommending two movies!!!! I’ve really done nothing else
      since the last letter. So, I truly do not give a fuck about the DCEU, and
      the sparing few movies I’ve seen from that set have been pretty
      bad-to-mediocre. And yet! I hate that I’m basically recommending this
      movie because #representation, but it was really so fucking fun. A
      wonderfully talented cast with women of color, queer characters who get to
      exist besides that, a perfect soundtrack, bright colors and exciting fight
      scenes…there’s no reason not to see it! I love to have fun! I would die
      for Margot Robbie. Ewan McGregor is the best villain. Directed by Cathy
      Yan. Also in theaters now!"

    title01: Tangerine
    desc01: I have been using [this app](https://www.tangerine.app/) for a few
      months as a beta tester, and I’m so happy that it is finally out there in
      the world for everyone else to use! Tangerine combines two of my favorite
      things—habit tracking, and mood tracking—in a beautiful and easy-to-use
      way. It’s made a difference in the way I approach my daily habits and
      routines, and has quickly become one of my most-used apps. You can
      download it on the [App
      Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tangerine/id1468882685).

    title02: Desk Lunch
    desc02: "I (obviously) love newsletters, and [this
      one](https://www.desklunchnewsletter.com/) is one of my very favorites.
      Every issue of Desk Lunch is written by a different creative person about
      their process, their life, their journey, their thoughts. The [latest
      issue](https://mailchi.mp/desklunchnewsletter/issue-97-perpetually-seekin\
      g-carolyn-yoo?e=b36865b50b), which I read this morning, was so good and
      relevant to me in particular—Carolyn Yoo writes about struggling to
      answer *“The Question”* of her career path: “Perhaps I would keep
      searching for what I was meant to do for many more years of my life, but I
      could learn to embrace the spiral instead of resenting that I hadn’t
      reached an answer yet.”
      Whew. [Subscribe](https://twitter.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9\

      like that."
