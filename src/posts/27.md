  intro:
    topic: letting go
    jillian: I’m having a hard time articulating why, but I feel calmer than usual
      lately. December is a weird month—there’s so much I feel like I need to
      squeeze in before the holidays come and the year ends, but I don’t feel
      frantic or anxious about it at all. I sort of feel like, *who cares?* As I
      wrote in an email to Summer last week, *I just want to do nothing and be
      comfy until January.* I’m ready to hunker down until the new year comes so
      I can re-emerge and start over, let go of all the things that aren’t
      working for me, make space for gratitude instead of guilt, etc. etc. etc.
      I’m trying not to ask too much of myself right now, which probably should
      not be a December-specific intention, but I’m welcoming it nonetheless.
    summer: I’ve discovered I do, in fact, keep grudges. I didn’t super know that
      about me. I thought I was a cool, chill girl. Nope! The other day I saw a
      Twitter account of an ex-friend and felt bitter. I saw a different one a
      few days later and felt the same, then frustrated. We mostly drifted, and
      yet I was letting the simple act of *maybe someone doesn’t love you* make
      me feel just awful. And now I am giving space to that feeling in this
      letter, and communicating it to all of you—I am very bad at deciding *I’m
      not going to let this bother me* and *I don’t want to talk about this
      anymore* but actually just, talking about it more, only, exclusively,
      loudly. I want to learn how to process The Bad. I am lucky to have a lot
      of people in my life who let me shout and complain and encourage my anger,
      almost, but I feel like a broken record; I can scream about the same thing
      forever, over and over, mostly because the things I scream about are
      linked to Bigger World Injustices (lol) but also I’m not sure how to
      truly *process.* Let go. Transform anger or bitterness. I want to figure
      it out.

    title01: "Cordite 94: Bayt"
    desc01: Zeina Hashem Beck curated this incredible issue of writers of Arab
      heritage for *Cordite*. There are 42 poems, a mini-chapbook, and a few
      essays. People I love dearly, dearly, dearly have work in this issue and
      there is very little I love more than poems & my friends. Check it
      out [here](http://cordite.org.au/)!

    title02: Fargo Tbakhi’s essay “Watching ‘The Last Black Man in San Francisco’ as
      a Palestinian-American”
    desc02: I might be double-dipping with the recommendations this week since Fargo
      also has a poem in the issue above, but listen! My friend is the smartest
      person in the world. This essay is part of my favorite genre of film
      writing—review by way of personal essay, a synthesis of all of the things
      we think about when experiencing something wonderful. He does such an
      incredible job linking so many different types of texts and relaying both
      the active experience of *watching* but also the more ever-present desire
      to relate, connect, map. It’s a great read regardless of whether or not
      you’ve seen the movie or whether or not you are Palestinian. Check it
      out [here](https://gay.medium.com/watching-the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco-as-a-palestinian-american-b0b67eca5931).

    title01: Tiny Spells
    desc01: "[Tiny Spells](https://tinyspells.xyz/) is a short, daily newsletter
      about self care—and not
      the *use-my-affiliate-link-to-buy-an-essential-oil-diffuser* kind of self
      care. (Valid! But not what we’re talking about here.) Tiny Spells lands in
      your inbox every day with three small, manageable things you can do to
      take care of yourself, like “Plan how you’re going to get your water
      intake up,” “Think about the smells that surround you,” and “Please book
      that doctor’s appointment you’ve been dodging.” And if you don’t need
      another newsletter, you can find them
      on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tiny_spells) instead."

    title02: Haley Houseman’s Tackling 2020 Workbook
    desc02: I love setting goals, and I love following directions. Naturally, [this
      goal-setting
      guide](http://www.hedhouseman.com/store/p1/Tackling_2020_Workbook.html#/) by
      the brilliant Haley Houseman is my new favorite thing. It is extremely
      thorough, and was made to walk you through the process of reflecting on
      2019 and setting yourself up for a good 2020, whatever that means for you.
      I’ve been slowly making my way through it for a few days, and it’s tough,
      but it’s eye-opening—in comparing where I was at the beginning of the year
      to where I am now, I’m starting to see more clearly what’s really
      important to me, and where my energy will be best spent next year. The
      workbook is currently on sale for $5, go give Haley your money!
