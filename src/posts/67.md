  intro:
    topic: sameness
    jillian: "We’ve been doing this newsletter thing for a while, and I couldn’t be
      prouder of it—when we started, I never really imagined that we’d be doing
      it consistently for long enough to get to the point where we’re struggling
      to come up with things to write about every week, but turns out: we have
      done exactly that! (Which is so cool!) At the beginning, it felt like
      there were so many things that we loved and couldn’t wait to recommend.
      Now, it’s hard to think of new things we haven’t mentioned already,
      because we’re both still just playing the same games and listening to the
      same music and doing the same things that we’ve loved for weeks and months
      and years. There’s not a lot of newness in our lives, and that makes a
      task like writing this newsletter especially difficult.
      Summer [tweeted](https://twitter.com/summabis/status/1360280294591324161?\
      s=12) something really good about this a while ago that I still think
      about all the time—the idea that beneath a lot of sameness, you can still
      search for the tiny, little things that are making your life good. In that
      way, writing Letters to Summer is kind of like keeping a gratitude
      journal. I’m so happy I get to keep doing it!"
    summer: "I’m not a routine person, as I’ve discussed on this newsletter, but
      there are things I gravitate towards for comfort—replaying Fire Emblem:
      Three Houses, for example, checking HBO Max’s Gossip Girl revival—but
      those aren’t very recommendable-things; sometimes I am very aware of my
      depressive states when I review what the last two weeks have looked like
      in order to put something together for the newsletter. Like, what have I
      done, really? Cry? Cool. That being said, it is good to think down to the
      nitty-gritty: what brought me joy? Like Jill said, it is a form of
      gratitude journal—would I have thought so carefully about my watermelon if
      my other silly little tasks were the same as they were last
      every-other-Thursday?"

      “[Ketchum,
      ID](https://open.spotify.com/track/2HbDLvUR0SA1o9BDMAqqNM?si=a18ff7a1cdf3483e)”
      came up on my Discover Weekly a few months ago and since it was soothing I
      added it to my sleep playlist—a few nights ago I decided to see what other
      songs were on the album and
      realized…[boygenius](https://open.spotify.com/album/6RjlLIuDFC8Dw91yRAdPz9?si=drfICuYZRqu_Z2GYLbopog&dl_branch=1)!
      Honestly, I think I like Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Daucus, and Julien Baker
      the most when they’re together. Just a good set of sad girl music with
      pretty harmonies.

    desc02: What’s that?
      I’m [recommending](https://letterstosummer.com/56/) [another](https://letterstosummer.com/30) [Jamie
      Loftus project](https://letterstosummer.com/25)? Yes! This time, she’s
      delving deep into the world of Cathy Comics, something I truly only know
      in zeitgeist—the first few episodes have been incredible, already rich
      with careful research and more thought than you could imagine. Jamie’s
      journalistic podcasts are truly a blueprint. [Check it

    title01: Pixaki
    desc01: "[Pixaki](https://pixaki.com/) is sort of like the Procreate of pixel
      art—it’s a really beautiful, easy-to-use iPad app for making pixel art
      that I’ve been using and loving for a few weeks. It’s plenty flexible
      enough for my purposes (making cute little pixel creations for my friends,
      mostly) and it’s really the only iPad app for pixel art that I’ve enjoyed
      using. There’s also [a free
      version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixaki-4-intro/id1524803334), if
      you want to try it out before committing!"

    title02: Threes
    desc02: You may or may not have picked up on this by now, but I like playing
      video games. That said, I haven’t really been much into mobile games
      lately (except for [Genshin Impact](https://letterstosummer.com/49/),
      which I play on my iPad). I’ve been sort of missing the era of playing
      games like Flappy Bird and Neko Atsume on my phone, so I subscribed
      to [Apple
      Arcade](https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/?itscg=10000&itsct=arc-0-apl_hp-lrn_tle-apl-ref-210507) and
      downloaded a bunch recently—so
      far, [Threes](http://play.threesgame.com/) is my favorite. Very similar to
      2048, it’s a great game when you just need a quick distraction or want to
      do something with your hands without opening Twitter and then closing
      Twitter and then opening Twitter again. It’s available on a bunch of
      mobile platforms, plus you can play it right on
      their [website](http://play.threesgame.com/)!
