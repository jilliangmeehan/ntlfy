  again, a cute app to keep you off your phone, a book about Palestinian rights,
  and a fun quarantine album.

  intro:
    topic: the cold
    jillian: I’ve spent this year dreading winter. Dreading the cold and the early
      sunsets, dreading the isolation of staying home all the time without sunny
      weekends to spend sitting in the park. Now that it’s here, it’s not so
      bad, I guess. It gets dark at 4:30, so I turn on the lamps and light a
      candle. My bedroom is cold, so I wear sweaters and have an extra blanket
      on my bed. I don’t go outside unless I need to, so I take vitamin D
      gummies every morning. I eat lots of soup, I put a virtual fireplace on
      the TV while I read, I drink hot tea in the morning (and then again in the
      afternoon), I play video games in bed under the covers—these are the
      things I do to feel cozy, which is not the same as feeling *not cold*. I
      think being cold is, a little bit, part of being cozy. And I think, at
      this point, I’m dreading the winter a little bit less.
    summer: I was born in Michigan. Our house was on a big hill, perfect for
      sledding; I remember falling into snow and feeling so cold I was warm. I
      remember the weather changing, warming, getting frustrated at layers and
      sweaters and snowpants, just wanting to be able to feel the real
      temperature of everything around me. I live in California now, alternating
      between the bay area and Los Angeles county, meaning my spectrum of
      temperature is…maybe 50F—100F. I like when temperatures drop, when I can
      snuggle with a blanket, wearing an oversized sweater that looks best with
      leggings. I don’t really know what *cold cold* feels like anymore, the
      last time I felt a real winter felt like a novelty (New York, Jan 2019)
      and snow is only something that dusts the mountaintops visible from the
      foothills. I am happy in my California winters. I am tired of fire season.
      I want to live in sweatpants and feel wind and let my hot coffee feel
      appropriate.

    title01: Gilmore Girls
    desc01: As always, I feel a little weird recommending something that is already
      massively popular—especially after its 20teens resurgence thanks to
      Netflix, but I have been doing very little else the past few weeks besides
      rewatching this show as my partner watches it for the first time. *Gilmore
      Girls* is, unfortunately, one of my defining traits; my relationship with
      it has waxed and waned across the years, going from obsessive, lonely 10
      year old cycling through the seasons on DVD on an endless loop—my first
      “binge watch”—to cynical high schooler frustrated with whiteness, to
      gleeful young adult happily engaging with the nonsense of rich people and
      the incredible dramatic precision. I can see parts of myself mapped in
      this show, seeing the places I attempted to be Rory, knowing the places I
      am more like Lane, joyfully pretending my messiness in the kitchen is as
      charming as Sookie. *Gilmore Girls* used to be between me & the TV, my
      family sitting behind me on the couch; today, it’s me & the [Gilmore
      Guys](http://www.gilmoreguysshow.com/), me & my Twitter timeline, me & my
      best friends, me & my boyfriend. I am corny, but that’s life baby! It’s on
      Netflix. Go feel fall and crave coffee at 8pm!

    title02: "The Pen and the Sword: Conversations with Edward Said"
    desc02: My friend Samia sent me [this
      book](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/888-the-pen-and-the-sword) a
      few weeks ago and it’s probably one of the more accessible texts I’ve read
      that discusses Zionism, Palestinian resistance, and anti-colonial looks at
      the study of literature—all of that, in one tiny little book! As every
      good little diaspora baby does, I consistently look to Said to help
      articulate things I observe, things I feel. Highly recommend for anyone
      who has wanted to read more Said but needs something more digestible!

    title01: Forest
    desc01: I’m trying to spend less time on my phone, trying to stop absentmindedly
      picking it up to check Twitter while I’m in the middle of doing other
      things. [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) is a very cute app that’s
      helping me with that, lately. You pick a length of time you want to spend
      off of your phone, and then the app plants a tree that starts growing as
      your timer counts down. If you close the app to do other things, your tree
      dies. A little dramatic, maybe, but it helps me make more mindful
      decisions about when I want to be on my phone and when I don’t.

    title02: BE
    desc02: BTS was the top artist in my Spotify Wrapped this year, even though I
      only started listening to them a few months ago. Nobody who knows me is
      surprised. Anyway, their [latest
      album](https://open.spotify.com/album/2qehskW9lYGWfYb0xPZkrS?si=699Ud167R6WgkYCsGs-IvA) has
      fun, chill quarantine vibes and it makes me happy.
