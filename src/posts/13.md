  intro:
    jillian: "I really don’t have anything to say that can top Summer finishing her
      thesis, so let’s just leave it at this: friends are extremely good,
      support your friends, support their work, and remind them that they are
      talented and wonderful and loved on a regular basis. Also, hire Summer."
    summer: MY THESIS IS DONEEEEEEEEEEEE DONE DONE DONE DONE DONEEEEE TURNED IN &
      EVERYTHINGGGGGG I DID IT! I did it. 49 pages about my favorite poets. All
      I have left is a project for my linguistics class and another paper for a
      poetry class, but at this point? Anything is possible. Everything is easy.
      RIP my identity as a student! Publishing world hire me!

    title01: Four Cities by Hala Alyan
    desc01: The bulk of my thesis was focusing on moments of eating in the poetry of
      Hala Alyan, particularly looking at her collection *Hijra*. When I was
      scoping out an opening quote for the paper as whole, I decided to look
      through one of her other collections that I hadn’t read through in a
      while, *Four Cities*, for inspiration. While I didn’t end up pulling
      anything from the poems in it, it reminded me just how absolutely stunning
      it is. My favorite poems by her, pre-\_Twenty Ninth Year\_ probably come
      from there? “Akko, and the Sun Sets” and “The Marketplace” are both
      stunning, masterful works that make me emo as hell. Buy
      it [here](https://www.blacklawrence.com/four-cities/).

    title02: Cuz I Love You by Lizzo
    desc02: This album! Lizzo is a goddess. I love her so much. Her music is so fun
      and she is such a brilliant vocalist and I literally can’t stop listening
      to this every single morning. [Stream it on
      Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6dFFcYQ8VhifgdKgYY5LYL).

    title01: Lord Jones CBD Tincture
    desc01: "I hope I don’t need to tell you about CBD, so I’ll just get right into
      it: I picked up [this CBD
      tincture](https://shop.lordjones.com/collections/cbd-tinctures/products/l\
      ord-jones-high-cbd-pain-wellness-formula-tincture?variant=8119195402351) \
      from a bougie pharmacy in Williamsburg on a frantic whim and it’s exactly
      what I needed in my life. I put a dropper (or two) under my tongue when
      I’m stressed, when I’m anxious, when I can’t sleep, when my body hurts, or
      when I just need a little bit of extra help relaxing at the end of the
      day. Bonus rec: if you want to try CBD and don’t know where to
      start, [Nice Paper](https://benicepaper.com/) is a really good women-owned
      resource on all things cannabis."

    title02: Youper
    desc02: "Mood tracking and journaling is a really essential part of my everyday
      routine, but I’m also very lazy and don’t like to exert much effort or
      spend more than a few minutes doing it on a daily basis.
      Enter [Youper](https://www.youper.ai/), an AI mental health app that I’ve
      been using for months. (Listen: I know “AI mental health app” sounds weird
      and scary, but I love it.) Every day, I tell Youper how I’m feeling and
      what external factors are contributing to my mood, and we walk through why
      I might be feeling the way I’m feeling. An app will never be a replacement
      for a therapist, but using Youper in addition to my regular therapy
      appointments has made a big difference in the way I recognize and process
      my emotions—which is why this is one of my favorite recommendations to
      give so far."
