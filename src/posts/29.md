  intro:
    topic: gratitude
    jillian: "I spent a lot of time thinking about gratitude this year, actually
      recognizing it as a tool in my life for the first time, actively
      practicing the act of feeling grateful and letting it transform the way I
      think and feel. I wrote down the things I am grateful for, and thought
      about those things, instead of dwelling on what hurt me. I won’t list all
      of those things here, but I will say that, above all, I have felt the most
      grateful for the feeling of *home* that I have found in my life. Finding
      gratitude has made me happier—that seems like such a simple way of putting
      it, but it’s true. Here is a simple thing to do that will have an impact
      on your life: think about what are you are grateful for today, write it
      down, say it out loud, commit it to memory, recognize it. Do it again
      tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that, etc."
    summer: It’s the first day of the year & I’ve seen a thousand wrap-up threads
      full of people’s accomplishments. I have very little to link people to
      besides this letter as an object of things I have finished, and I am okay
      with it. I almost said I didn’t accomplish anything, but that is not
      true—I wrote a thesis, I was on a slam team, I graduated, I got a job, I
      was honest with my feelings again & again & again. But really, I am
      really, truly thankful to be surrounded by an immense amount of talented
      people. I toyed with doing a gratitude thread, just publicly thanking the
      dozens of people who made me feel safe & loved in 2019, but it felt silly;
      I can just tell them personally! In the last year or so, I’ve gotten into
      the habit of telling people when I think of them even if we haven’t spoken
      in a while, generally checking-in by text, etc. I’m not sure if the
      practice has improved any of my relationships but it does feel nice to
      feel free telling people they are on your mind. I want to continue this,
      push it further. I’m grateful for my friends, but I want to be specific
      with it, and everything else moving forward. Tell people you love
      them!!!!! It’s so so good!!!

    title01: Little Women (2019)
    desc01: I feel bold recommending this without having read the book nor seeing
      any other adaption, but folks! This movie was a warm hug but also not
      like, necessarily comforting. Maybe more like a solemn “yeah,” a nod, and
      a pat on the back. It was beautiful. I am in love with every cast member.
      I think about Greta Gerwig and all of the discourse her name carries (just
      ask if you don’t know, lol) almost constantly these days, and since
      seeing *Little Women* my thoughts have been basically all positive. If you
      were on the fence about seeing it, go have fun! Cry a little! Yearn for
      poofy skirts & leather bound-books!

    title02: The Mandalorian
    desc02: I saw *The Rise of Skywalker* the day it came out and it was awful, for
      reasons I do not need to get into right now, but personally the worst part
      of my viewing was perhaps 3/4ths of the way through when all I could think
      was, “Wait…maybe all *Star Wars* are bad? Have I been caught in a
      nostalgia loop since the earlier 2000s?” But no! *Star Wars* is good, camp
      is good, etc etc. And this show! Reinforces how much I love that
      franchise! It gives a nice look at places in the *Star Wars* universe
      without it always being life-or-death and, strangely, explores a very
      healthy father-son relationship. Pedro Pascal is so good!!!! And he’s in a
      big hunk of metal suit the whole time!!!! I WILL die for The
      Child!!! [Watch

    title01: Conversations with Friends by Sally Rooney
    desc01: Full disclosure: [this
      book](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780451499066) destroyed me. I feel
      like I am the last person on earth to read *Conversations with Friends*,
      but I would feel silly not mentioning it in a newsletter about things I
      love, because I truly loved it. It’s exactly as good as everyone says, and
      as soon as I started reading it I could feel all of my friends laughing at
      me, because it felt like it was engineered in a lab to be exactly the book
      I needed to read. Maybe it’s exactly the book you need to read, too.

    title02: Welcome to Union Glacier
    desc02: A little over a week ago, I was reading [The
      Abundance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25776682-the-abundance), a
      collection of Annie Dillard essays, and the final chapter was a bit
      from [Teaching a Stone to
      Talk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12534.Teaching_a_Stone_to_Talk) about
      Antarctica. Something about the way she wrote about antarctic exploration
      and expeditions made me hungry for more (isn’t it fun to get suddenly very
      into a niche topic like this?) and my boyfriend recommended [this
      documentary](https://vimeo.com/107231188) about Union Glacier and the
      small team of people who work there. I watched it on a cold day in my
      apartment, feeling cozy on the couch with a cup of tea, and I loved it.
      And please, if you have any of your own recommendations for
      Antarctica-related content, send it my way.
