  intro:
    topic: change
    jillian: "A nice thing about projects like this oneâ€”fun personal projects with
      low stakes that you have total creative control overâ€”is that you can do
      whatever you want with them. If you have a bunch of new ideas, you can try
      them out. If something isnâ€™t working, you can go in a different direction
      instead. I often find change in my personal life scary and
      anxiety-inducing, but trying new things with a side project is exciting.
      This is all to say: we have
      aÂ [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/letterstosummer)Â now! You can sign up
      at different tiers to get some (hopefully) cool bonus content from us! And
      we will be donating 100% of the proceeds to a different organization every
      month, starting withÂ [The Okra Project](https://www.theokraproject.com/)!
      Iâ€™m happy we have a chance to do something like this, and Iâ€™m even happier
      to look back and see how far this little newsletter has come since the
      beginning. I hope you like it, too."
    summer: "I am less afraid of change than I am of being an inconsistent person.
      Iâ€™m not ritualistic, Iâ€™m horrible at keeping habitsâ€”most of my day-to-day
      is a series of small changes with how I approach my work, my life, my
      friends. There are ways to frame this more generously: spontaneous!
      eclectic! very cool and fun!, but difficult to assign when changing an
      Animal Crossing villager stresses me out. I want to remember the facets of
      change that are good, the ones that allow you to define yourself further:
      change that builds upon itself, change that leaves you refreshed, change
      that leaves you excited. The world is exhausting and I am bad at doing
      things, but this newsletter is a constant. Iâ€™m happy to be doing things
      with Jill to make us both feel refreshed and re-excited about doing
      anything again."

    title01: The Black Maria by Aracelis Girmay
    desc01: A few weeks ago I was seeking comfort and realized more than anything, I
      wanted to re-readÂ *Kingdom Animalia*Â by Aracelis Girmay,Â [which I have
      recommended on this newsletter before](https://letterstosummer.com/22). I
      didnâ€™t have my copy with me, which was tragic, but I realized I could just
      buy a different Aracelis Girmay book! And so I did!Â *The Black
      Maria*Â continues to affirm my belief that Aracelis Girmay can do
      practically anything with a poem and you still know she wrote it, because
      no one can do it like she can!!! Thereâ€™s a signature vibe, an energy,
      something I could talk about more in depth if I was smarter or less tired.
      This collection, formally, is so fucking cool; poems blend into each
      other, it feels epic but distinct. I am always in awe!Â [Go buy a
      copy!](https://www.boaeditions.org/products/the-black-maria)

    title02: Mujiâ€™s pens & stationery
    desc02: Forgive me if youâ€™ve heard of this worldwide corporation before, but
      they recently declared bankruptcy in the US and I am feeling some type of
      way. Muji pens are my favorite to write with and their notebooks changed
      everything for me! Small, simply cute, and just enough pages for a
      semester! You can peruse theirÂ [online
      store](https://www.muji.us/store/stationery.html). My favorite is the
      purple capped gel-ink pen.

    title01: One Anti-Racist Action a Day
    desc01: "[This newsletter](https://oneaction.today/)Â is exactly what it sounds
      like: a daily reminder of something you can do to be anti-racist, support
      the Black Lives Matter movement, and care for the people in your
      community. Sometimes it has a link to a petition to sign, sometimes it has
      a template for an email to send, and sometimes it has something for you to
      read. To be clear: subscribing to this newsletter should not be the extent
      of your anti-racism work, but it is a really great place to start if
      youâ€™ve been feeling overwhelmed by resources or want a daily reminder to
      hold yourself accountable."

    title02: Cute face masks
    desc02: "Guess what! We are in the middle of a pandemic! And you should
      absolutely be wearing a face mask every time you leave your house! I got
      aÂ [pack of
      three](https://losangelesapparel.net/products/3-pack-cotton-mask?variant=\
      31978394189886)Â reusable cloth ones (pink, of course) back in March, but
      recently ordered another fromÂ [Piehole](https://piehole.bigcartel.com/).
      Theyâ€™re making a bunch of cute, reusable masks and donating 50% of the
      proceeds to an organization of your choice. Bottom line: weâ€™re going to be
      wearing masks for a while, so you might as well stock up on some cute ones
      that look good with your outfits."
