  intro:
    topic: coziness
    jillian: "A few months ago, I was in Powell’s looking for an entirely different
      book when I found [*Cozy* by Isabel
      Gillies](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062654151/cozy/)—I had to buy
      it. I read it slowly, savoring the short but satisfying chapters dedicated
      to picking apart an activity, a place, or an object and exploring what
      makes it cozy. Even the book itself is cozy, with its hard cover and blue
      ink and deckle edge pages, and reading it was a lesson in finding the
      coziness in everything. I started a note on my phone of things in my
      apartment that are cozy (you should do this) and looking at it makes me
      feel warm and safe: the light above the stove, the magnets on the fridge,
      the light coming in through the linen curtains in the morning, the wood
      floors, the rice cooker, the eucalyptus in the shower, the noise the
      dishwasher makes, the kitchen shelf with mugs, the doorbell that nobody
      knows about, the pink dutch oven that sits on top of the fridge, the
      candles that I light every night. Cozy is a feeling and a place and a mood
      and a state of being all at once—and it’s everywhere."
    summer: "I write this from the perspective of a fragile Californian, but: I am
      cold. I wake up, more reluctant than ever to throw the covers off and
      start my day. A few days ago, I was having more trouble than usual leaving
      my apartment when I remembered this overwhelmingly large, cushy, black
      cardigan I have (with nice big pockets that sag if you put anything in
      them), and felt able to go. Coziness is akin to warmth is akin to safety,
      and there’s nothing that signals safety more than wrapping yourself up. I
      do not dislike the cold; I have so much affection for the wind,
      particularly the way it whips my face and how I imagine it filling the
      bags under my eyes. This, however, only emphasizes the need for comfy
      things more—if I am to interact with my favorite weather, I have to be
      prepared. Scarves; it’s keffiyeh season, and I pair my Palestine necklaces
      with a more obvious symbol around my neck. Sweaters; body dysmorphia does
      not get solved with a new outfit, but I have always loved turtlenecks.
      Warm drinks; a constant, but more appropriate than ever."

    title01: The Bechdel Cast
    desc01: I love this podcast! Jamie Loftus and Caitlin Durante discuss the
      portrayal of women in movies (and all of the things that go along with
      that discussion). They are funny, fair, smart, and recognize their points
      of ignorance as two white women. I’ve made my way through every episode in
      the main feed that discusses a movie I’ve watched, am now subscribed to
      the Patreon (Matreon, excuse me), and have gotten to the point of
      re-listening to episodes to fall asleep to. Which is true love for me and
      a podcast, basically. They make me happy and I do think I’ve started
      watching movies differently. They do a great job of balancing criticism
      and recognizing that sometimes you just like things, too!!!! I’d recommend
      starting with
      their [Booksmart](https://www.bechdelcast.com/podcasts/booksmart-with-vanessa-chester.htm) or [Good
      Will
      Hunting](https://www.bechdelcast.com/podcasts/good-will-hunting-with-ayo-edebiri.htm) (a
      movie I haven’t seen, but I’ll listen to anything with Ayo Edebiri)
      episodes.

    title02: The CW’s Nancy Drew
    desc02: "I love Nancy Drew! She has followed me for such a long time, in so many
      different iterations. *Nancy Drew* books were my in-betweens, what I would
      read when waiting for another book to be available at the library. Their
      inconsistencies bothered me to no end, but I was only ten, and never read
      two in a row, so why Nancy’s hair was always a different shade of blonde
      was a mystery I never solved. I learned more and more about the sort of
      sinister history of the books, their re-writes, the way Nancy was deemed
      “Too Cool” by a 1950s audience and thus disempowered as a protagonist. The
      sort of slow burn of understanding the character’s history definitely
      helps my utter enjoyment of the *Riverdale-*ification of the new CW
      series, in which Nancy is cool as shit. There are just a few episodes, and
      they’re campy as hell, but the show is truly SO COMPELLING. And honestly
      scary! I’m a big wimp so you can argue with me on that point, but WOW. I
      am having an incredible time, and my boyfriend who knew nothing about
      Nancy Drew agrees: this show rocks. It airs Thursday nights on the CW!
      Please talk to me about it!"

    title01: Jenny Slate’s Stage Fright
    desc01: >-
      Jenny Slate is my mother and my wife and my best friend and my baby! I
      very deeply fell in love with her when I read [this Vulture
      interview](https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/jenny-slate-gifted-chris-evans-breakup.html) from
      2017, and then again when I read [this Vulture
      interview](https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/jenny-slate-interview-the-sunlight-night-at-sundance.html) from
      earlier this year, which I have [already
      mentioned](https://letterstosummer.com/6) in this newsletter and will
      continue to mention until the end of time. And now her comedy
      special, [Stage Fright](https://www.netflix.com/title/81027753), is on
      Netflix for me to watch on a weekly basis for the rest of my life,
      probably. It is unlike any comedy special I’ve ever watched.


      \[note from Summer: it made me cry! that’s comedy, baby!]

    title02: Cavern of Secrets
    desc02: "[Cavern of
      Secrets](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/katie-jensen-2/cavern-of-secret\
      s) was, I think, the first podcast I ever really loved. I remember
      listening to it and stifling laughter on the Northeast Regional trip on my
      way home from college. I was devastated when it ended, but I gradually
      moved on, opening myself up to an entire world of podcasts that I now
      listen to on a daily basis. What I’m saying is: before Cavern of Secrets,
      I thought podcasts had to be boring. Turns out they can be deeply funny
      and interesting and warm! And this one is the funniest, most interesting,
      and warmest of them all, imho. The extremely good news is that it is back,
      with six new episodes! It’s the same Cavern of Secrets that I loved in
      2016, and it’s kind of wild to listen to it now and remember who I was and
      what I was doing when I was listening to it the first time, on that
      Amtrak. I highly recommend listening to the latest episodes, but I also
      recommend going through the back catalogue, because it has some of the
      most brilliant, hilarious conversations I’ve ever heard."
