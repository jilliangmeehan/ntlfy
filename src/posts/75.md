  intro:
    topic: Animal Crossing
    jillian: I have loved Animal Crossing for a long time, and New Horizons is no
      exceptionâ€”even though I stopped playing it on a daily basis a few months
      after it came out, I was always happy to pick it back up again whether I
      had a burst of inspiration to work on my island or just wanted to slow
      down and wander around and talk to my villagers. Iâ€™ve watched a lot of
      people start to lose interest in the game in the past year or so because
      they ran out of things to do, and I get that! I think itâ€™s natural and
      okay to move on from games after the initial excitement has worn offâ€”all
      that means is there are other things in your life that youâ€™d rather spend
      your time doing, and thereâ€™s nothing wrong with that. But my favorite part
      of Animal Crossing, from the very first game, has always been the little
      daily routine of logging on, checking up on your town and the villagers in
      it, and then justâ€¦doing nothing. Taking it slow. Walking around and
      catching bugs. I know it doesnâ€™t sound like much, but it makes me happy,
      and itâ€™s something I canâ€™t really find in any other game. I have more
      thoughts on the new paid DLC (which I love) below, but the latest 2.0
      update has been making me so, so happy for the past few days. If you
      havenâ€™t played ACNH in a while, this might be a good time to pick it back
      up again!
    summer: I had my first good day in a long time yesterday and part of it was due
      to the fact that I actually finished all of my tasks and didnâ€™t have
      projects hanging like a sad little storm cloud over my head as I went into
      the evening. Frankly, the motivation to play Animal Crossing without worry
      was a big motivator! There is nothing better than feeling inspired to fuck
      around with my island and excited about what the dailies will bring. The
      update has revitalized and brought back that rush of joy you get when you
      buy a fresh new game! Iâ€™m so happy.

    title01: Japanese Breakfast Live Album
    desc01: "Ever since I listened to Jubilee I have become a Michelle Zauner Stan,
      and so I am rewarded with my favorite thing: aÂ [live
      album](https://open.spotify.com/album/6v1WdsONXHBh8sCWCQWYUJ?si=T26GOKbvS\
      wG7NCmdBmzyuQ&utm_source=copy-link)! It has some of my favorite hits from
      Jubilee and more."

    title02: Insecure
    desc02: I finally started watching Insecure a few weeks ago and oh my god! Itâ€™s
      perfect. It makes me want to be normal and live my life? Which is good
      when youâ€™ve been in a horrible depression for months and months. There are
      four full seasons on HBOMax and the fifth is coming out now.

    title01: Splatoon 2
    desc01: I spent years
      ignoringÂ [Splatoon](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/splatoon-2-switch/)Â and
      refusing to learn what it even is, and then this week I watched a friend
      of mine play it and I was like,Â *oh wait that looks kinda fun?*Â So I
      downloaded it the next day. And itÂ *is*Â fun! Itâ€™s great to play either by
      yourself or with friends, and itâ€™s way more casual than any other online
      multiplayer FPS-kinda game Iâ€™ve ever played. Also there are fun outfits,
      which is obviously the most important part of any game.

    title02: Happy Home Paradise
    desc02: If you somehow havenâ€™t already heard, there isÂ [a new paid
      DLC](https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/animal-crossing-new-horizons-happy-home-paradise-dlc-available-now/)Â for
      Animal Crossing New Horizons called Happy Home Paradiseâ€”if you played
      Happy Home Designer on your DS as a kid, this is the new and much-improved
      version of it! Iâ€™ve been playing it for a few days and I love it so far.
      Taking a break from my own island and spending time decorating little
      vacation homes for characters in the game is a really fun way to exercise
      my creativity and practice some decorating ideas without the pressure of
      having to look for items that I want and commit to changing up my own
      space. I think if you like decorating in Animal Crossing, want more
      objectives in the game, and are feeling overwhelmed by your own island,
      thereâ€™s no reason you shouldnâ€™t give the DLC a try!
