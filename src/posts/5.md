  you to watch (they're right), a heartwrenching poetry collection, and tidying
  up.

  intro:
    jillian: SUMMER CAME TO NEW YORK AND I GOT TO SEE HER. Wow! I love my friend!
      Also, it’s been an entire year since I moved to New York and started my
      current job. ALSO, I’m moving into a new apartment.
    summer: JILLIAN & I WERE REUNITED AND I LOVE HER! SO MUCH! I spent a week in New
      York City & only cried on the plane ride there. I grow stronger every day.

    title01: Reunions
    desc01: "I’ve never recommended something metaphysical before, but if there’s
      anything I had a lot of exposure to in the past week, it’s this: seeing
      people I love who I had not seen in a long time, remembering how much my
      heart ached the last time I saw them, and feeling all of that melt into
      joy. Keeping in touch is powerful. Honestly, fuck “if you love me let me
      go”—people can be their whole selves while still being part of you, too."

    title02: Invasive species by Marwa Helal
    desc02: Not to be dramatic but Marwa Helal is the best poet I’ve ever
      read? [This entire
      collection](https://www.amazon.com/Invasive-species-Marwa-Helal/dp/1937658937) is
      brilliant, but I particularly enjoy the middle section, Immigration as a
      second language. The way she pushes genre is aspirational; this is true
      throughout the collection, but the awareness of language the poems possess
      is disarming & productive–the poems know they are poems and know they are
      making up for the failure of language in the failing language. It’s heart
      wrenching even in the most straight-forward moments. Marwa is amazing and
      I am so happy to be alive the same time she is producing work.

    title01: The Good Place
    desc01: "I put off watching [this
      show](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad\
      =rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjrqav1mPXfAhWDg-AKHdlGAEMQFjACegQIGhAB&url=https%3\
      A%2F%2Fwww.nbc.com%2Fthe-good-place&usg=AOvVaw0szHorGs8s_MRr2_J2hmd7) for\
       *so* long for the stupidest reason: everyone else was telling me to watch
      it and I didn’t want to do it out of spite. Usually I try not to be this
      person, because there’s nothing cool about refusing to enjoy things that
      everyone else likes, but I was genuinely worried that *The Good Place* was
      overhyped. I didn’t want to be disappointed and end up being the one freak
      who doesn’t like best show on television (an extremely Too Online ™️
      mood!) but it turns out there was nothing to worry about. Because it is
      the best show on television and I love it! You were all right. No further
      questions."

    title02: Marie Kondo
    desc02: This is partially a recommendation for Netflix’s new show [Tidying Up
      with Marie
      Kondo](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=21&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjz0LChofPfAhUwnOAKHQIFANEQFjAUegQICRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.netflix.com%2Ftitle%2F80209379&usg=AOvVaw30XNabsjXZcQky7PhIvU3N),
      partially a recommendation for the best-selling book [The Life-Changing
      Magic of Tidying
      Up](https://konmari.com/products/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up),
      and partially a recommendation for Marie Kondo herself, who is just a
      wonderful human person. None of us deserve her!
