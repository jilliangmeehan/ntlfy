  intro:
    topic: Fall
    jillian: On one hand, I like fall a lot. I like the cooler temperatures and that
      feeling that hangs in the air that reminds me of being in school or going
      trick or treating as a kid. I like wearing big sweaters and thick socks. I
      like the corny Hallmark smell of autumn-themed candles. On the other hand,
      I hate that it’s already dark by 7 pm, and I hate that it’s going to keep
      getting dark earlier and earlier. I hate that it’s going to get harder to
      make outdoor plans as it gets colder when I’m already barely leaving my
      apartment. I hate that wearing a mask fogs up my glasses even worse when
      the temperature drops below 70 degrees. But there’s nothing I can do about
      any of that—fall is here! We are still in the middle of a pandemic and we
      are still learning how to cope! The best I can do is appreciate the
      coziness of having a warm drink inside, invest in a SAD lamp, and look
      forward to the fall Animal Crossing update, I guess. We’re in this
      together!!!
    summer: I’ve been craving a seasonal coffee since September hit. Although I was
      never a big Starbucks fan, the cafes near my college and old apartment
      would conform to the trend with peppermint mochas, pumpkin spice, eggnog
      lattes, etc—there was always something new and special to try once the
      wind started blowing a bit colder. Of course, I’m in California, so much
      of this month has been windows closed, air purifier on, N95 and surgical
      masks doubled up to take my laundry out to the washer. Although my area is
      lucky enough to have had less smokey days, the season still doesn’t feel
      real. I want to wear long sleeves and drink something artificially
      flavored! I want to need a scarf because I am asthmatic and my chest is
      getting cold! I’m unlearning the East Coast hegemonic conditioning of “4
      seasons” since I’ve been living in California for so long, but the seasons
      feel so, so fake in quarantine. I love fall, but like, is it really here?

    title01: The High School Musical Trilogy
    desc01: My partner and I have been going through the *High School
      Musical* trilogy these past few days, just for fun, and hey! They’re still
      great, better than *La La Land.* After watching *Down to Earth with Zac
      Efron,* I think I have a different fondness for him, because I’m seeing
      Troy in a different light than I had before. He’s a good boy! They’re all
      on Disney+, go have fun!

    title02: Wendy Xu’s Interview with Merlin Sheldrake
    desc02: "[Wendy Xu](http://www.artofwendyxu.com/) is one of my favorite artists.
      She has a few graphic novels out, several shorter comics you can get
      on [gumroad](https://gumroad.com/wendyxu), and occasionally does these
      really wonderful comic-essays. Probably my favorite one so far came out on
      Catapult a few weeks ago, a
      hybrid [review-interview](https://catapult.co/stories/in-the-wilds-of-an-\
      open-soil-with-merlin-sheldrake-entangled-biology-publishing-fungi-wendy-\
      xu) of the book *In the Wilds of an Open Soil* by Merlin Sheldrake; she’s
      illustrated their conversation about his book about mushrooms and
      foraging, and it’s just so utterly charming and fantastical."

    title01: Rookie Print Sale
    desc01: There are a few days left to buy a very cool print or sticker set from
      the [Rookie Print Sale](https://www.rookieprintsale.com/), a fundraiser
      donating 100% of the proceeds to the [Movement Voter
      Project](http://movement.vote/). They’re selling a lot of really cool art,
      and you can help them support a bunch of local grassroots orgs that are
      working to get more people voting this fall. (Also, if you haven’t
      registered to vote or requested your mail-in ballot yet, [please do
      so!](https://www.vote.org/))

    title02: Among Us
    desc02: If you somehow haven’t already heard of Among Us, you’re welcome. It’s a
      very silly and fun multiplayer mafia-type game, where you work together as
      a team to complete a bunch of silly little tasks on a spaceship and find
      out which player is an imposter trying to kill everyone. It’s chaotic and
      perfect and I very much recommend playing it online with a bunch of
      friends. Available
      on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360/Among_Us/) (Windows
      only) or [mobile](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/among-us/id1351168404). I
      also recommend [watching people play it on
      Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Among%20Us)—it’s so funny.
