  intro:
    topic: routines
    jillian: "I’m still figuring out my relationship to routines, and I suspect I
      will be forever. I’ve always loved the idea of having the perfect morning
      or nighttime routine, but routines are hard to force. I’ve successfully
      replaced my habit of checking Instagram as soon as I wake up with the
      routine of reading a few articles in my Instapaper queue and spending a
      few minutes journaling before I get ready for work, but I still need a
      daily reminder to read a book and drink a cup of tea before I go to bed to
      avoid scrolling through Twitter until midnight. But my life is full of
      tiny routines that I don’t pay much attention to—so I made a list of them:
      the routine of making a cup of tea and filling up my water bottle and
      eating a protein bar as soon as I get to my office, the routine of
      listening to the same podcasts in the same order during my commute every
      week, the routine of folding clothes and putting them away, the routine of
      putting on makeup, the routine of lighting a candle with a match and then
      leaving the match out on the table instead of throwing it away, the
      routine of texting my boyfriend every night before I go to bed, the
      routine of washing my face in the shower while my hair sits with
      conditioner in for a few minutes, the routine of emptying the dishwasher
      in the same order every time, the routine of checking the mail when I get
      home. I find comfort in making lists like this, just like I find comfort
      in my routines."
    summer: I’m awful at routines, awful at keeping habits, awful at following
      through with any sort of consistency. This means I’m sort of awful at
      taking care of myself outside of the necessities. It’s not that I get
      tired of repetition, it’s just that I’m actually tired. I am my own worst
      enemy, keeping myself from ever repairing the damage eczema and anxiety
      have done to my skin because I cannot fathom the long-term exertion of
      caring for myself on the regular. There were points in time in which I
      washed my face with coconut oil, dried my budding zits with apple cider
      vinegar, and finished off with a carefully selected night cream; this
      routine was maybe too much too soon, as it fizzled out fast. The only
      routine I truly name a routine, rather than just an attempt at remaining a
      person, is making coffee. Yes, I am addicted to caffeine and will get
      mind-numbing headaches without it, but the mornings I forego making my own
      coffee (when I buy it, or know it’s available at work, etc.) always feel
      off. The calm of setting up my drip—the only dish I wash right away—and
      spooning too-many-grounds into the filter subdues my generalized morning
      anxiety. I begin with a sense of control. I want more to cling to, I want
      more things I can name part of myself, but for now? …coffee good.

    title01: It Must Be Heaven
    desc01: I got to see [this film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8359842/) at the
      opening night of the Arab Film Fest in San Francisco a few weeks ago. It’s
      directed by Elia Suleiman, a Palestinian director from Nazareth; so you
      know, basically family. It’s Palestine’s entry for the Oscars this year
      and probably the most I’ve ever cared about a movie getting nominated.
      It’s a vignette-y, quiet, poetic film taking place in Nazareth, Paris, New
      York, and then Nazareth again with just really BEAUTIFUL moments. There’s
      not a lot of dialogue, but the lines that exist…buddy, am I still thinking
      about them! If this movie comes to theaters near you, ABSOLUTELY see it.
      I’m still processing some parts of it that I have questions about, and
      have barely anyone to talk to about it! Help me!

    title02: Bon Appetit’s lemon pound cake
    desc02: I’ve been making a startling amount of things in my loaf pan, to varying
      degrees of success. My favorite so far was a banana bread that I know I
      can truly never replicate—but [this lemon pound
      cake](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/lemon-pound-cake)…it’s beautiful.
      Honestly, I kind of fucked up the actual cake, but the recipe itself is
      very good and I could *taste* what it was *supposed* to taste like, yknow?
      Anyway, no one I shared it with complained, but we all agreed it could be
      more lemon-y. Make sure your lemons are not tiny and sad, and also
      remember to wear gloves if your hands are riddled with cuts, like mine
      are.

    title01: How to Not Always Be Working
    desc01: "Here are two things that I love: working on too many side projects at
      the same time, and books that give me homework. I scrolled past a photo
      of [How to Not Always Be
      Working](https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Always-Working-Creativity/dp/0062\
      803670/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1554865512&sr=8-1https://w\
      ww.amazon.com/How-Not-Always-Working-Creativity/dp/0062803670/ref=tmm_pap\
      _swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1554865512&sr=8-1) on Instagram, and it
      stayed in my head until I finally sought it out and grabbed one of two
      copies at Powell’s while I was visiting Portland. This is a book for
      anybody who routinely blurs the line between work and not-work, and also
      anybody who likes to take notes and make lists, as I do. For a little over
      a week, I started every morning by reading a chapter from this book and
      writing down anything I wanted to remember—lists of what I do for work vs.
      what I do for me, a description of my dream workspace, affirmations to
      think about when I’m feeling anxious or imposter syndrome-y. It’s often
      harder than we think to draw a line between “work” and “life,” and this
      book encourages reflection and exploration to find a balance that’s right
      for you."

    title02: Notion
    desc02: I feel corny saying this, but [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) has
      changed my life. It’s almost hard to explain what Notion is, because it is
      so many things—for me, it is a to-do list, a goal tracker, a home for
      various projects and notes. We use Notion to draft this newsletter and
      keep track of our past and future recommendations. Most recently, I used
      Notion to plan out a new game of Stardew Valley, because that’s just my
      personality. The point is, you can use it for almost anything you want,
      across devices. For a more coherent and professional description, [visit
      their website](https://www.notion.so/). It’s great. You’re welcome.
