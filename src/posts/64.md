  intro:
    topic: summer
    jillian: It’s June and I still don’t have an air conditioner yet, which has not
      been very fun. The weather has been oscillating between 80 to 90 degree
      humidity—days where I have to keep the windows open and a box fan so loud
      I can’t hear anything else pointed directly at my body at all times—and 50
      to 60 degree rainy gloominess—days where I have to sit under a blanket on
      the couch and I can’t go outside without an umbrella. This is the
      in-between of spring and summer, I guess. I don’t mind the rain, because
      it’s cozy and it gives me a reprieve from the heat. And I don’t mind the
      heat, because it’s nice to spend time outside and feel the sun on my skin.
      I guess it would be too much to ask for something in the middle. My air
      conditioner gets here next week, and the temperatures will go up, and I
      will go the park with my friends and sweat in the sun.
    summer: "OK name pun out of the way, my name is actually Arabic not the season,
      means something even cooler, etc etc. I was looking outside around 7pm the
      other day and thought about how it was still light outside, maybe just
      getting dark. I can remember one summer evening in Michigan where I was
      running around my neighborhood until very late (for a small child), maybe
      9:30? and it was still light out! And it was just so amazing that it was
      night time but the sun was still around. That agonizingly long of a day
      doesn’t happen in California, or maybe it does and I just do not go
      outside enough! I do not like hot weather, truthfully. What summer does
      mark for me, though, is an incredible amount of fruit I love: apricots,
      watermelon, figs—I wait all year for fig season."

    title01: Pizza for dinner
    desc01: Listen, I am SO tired every day & there’s a constant barrage of poison
      gurgling around in my brain because of my Twitter addiction or the World
      Events making me feel inhuman & sometimes! nothing sounds appetizing
      except pizza. There have been a few times the past two weeks or so where I
      just ordered a pizza instead of looking in the fridge and it increased my
      mood significantly; listen, pizza isn’t even my main comfort food. But I
      guess we’re all different after over a year of being inside! Everyone
      should order a pizza in my honor.

    title02: NAZAR
    desc02: "[This newsletter](https://nazar.substack.com/) by Vanessa Taylor covers
      surveillance, often specifically how it affects Black Muslim communities.
      It was on break for a little bit but is officially back! I’ve learned a
      lot—tech writing through the lens of the harm of surveillance is the main
      angle I am interested in, and this newsletter encompasses a broad scope
      under that lens. Start with [this
      letter](https://nazar.substack.com/p/muslim-abolitionists-on-islam-carcer\
      al) with testimonies from Muslim Abolitionists."

    title01: Madoka Magica
    desc01: I watched Madoka Magica for the first time while I was recovering from
      my second dose of Moderna and uh. Wow! It’s probably one of the coolest
      shows I’ve ever seen—the story is absolutely devastating and twists the
      magical girl genre in a dark, satisfying way. And the art style is just
      really really neat. It’s only 12 episodes, so watch it
      on [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/puella-magi-madoka-magica-085f5007-1b32-4dd7-9aea-41397554fb9b) over
      the weekend if you want to cry!

    title02: Mario Kart
    desc02: I’ve been playing a lot of online with my friends lately and it
      is *so* fun!!! I’ve always loved Mario Kart, but I’m particularly enjoying
      its resurgence in my life right now. So if you’re looking for fun, kinda
      low effort ways to hang out with friends for an evening, set up an online
      multiplayer game and go wild. Our favorite, most chaotic match is 200cc on
      the Baby Park course with shells only. It makes me feel like I’m driving
      four cars at once and they’re all on fire, and it’s great.
