  intro:
    jillian: My favorite thing about this newsletter is that every two weeks, a
      couple of days before we’re supposed to send it, one of us dashes a quick
      “oh shit, I forgot we have to write a newsletter” text to the other and we
      scramble to get it together in time to send out. We are very good at this!
      I’m looking forward to a new year dedicated to never improving this
      process!
    summer: "Happy New Year! It’s difficult to trust the US Government or feel
      excited about anything Congress does in any way, but I highly recommend
      checking out the tag #TweetYourThobe on Twitter. It’s full of Palestinian
      women wearing traditional Palestinian garb to celebrate the swearing in of
      the first Palestinian-American congresswoman, Rashida Tlaib! I have a lot
      of mixed emotions about visibility and representation in a system that has
      caused us so much harm, but it’s a step in some way, and there’s a lot of
      joy to go around."

    title01: My Hero Academia (or, rather, the feeling it gives me)
    desc01: "I can trace my current life as a person who is Constantly Online™ to a
      YouTube ad suggesting that my
      Club-Penguin-Music-Video-watching-ten-year-old-self tune in to Ouran High
      School Host Club, fully subbed & dubbed on Funimation’s channel. It lead
      me to enter fandom in a way I hadn’t yet experienced—sure, I was part of
      the Disney Channel RPF crew in a way I didn’t fully understand, but I
      wasn’t truly *immersed*. And then I found DeviantArt, and role-playing on
      Formspring, and Tumblr, and I saw that it didn’t have to be anime that you
      fell so wholeheartedly in love with, it could be anything—Glee,
      Supernatural, Marvel—there was a niche for love gently holding hands with
      obsession for any piece of media. It’s been a while since I felt that
      overwhelming feeling of having to know absolutely everything, experiencing
      a thing at its absolute core. Even if I thought I felt that way with my
      favorite shows/movies/books in recent years, I didn’t realize how much I
      missed this almost hyperfixation. But here it is, again. [My Hero
      Academia](https://www.funimation.com/shows/my-hero-academia/) combines all
      of the things I love: teens being teens, people caring deeply about others
      to the point where it hurts, superpowers, cool battles, the works. It’s
      been like, two weeks since I watched the first episode of the anime, and a
      week since I caught up with the manga, and I’ve almost exhausted all of
      the ways I like to think about a series once I fall: character futures,
      interviews with the creator, Pokemon teams, etc. etc. This is a super
      popular anime, and you don’t really need my recommendation. I’m
      recommending the pure, unadulterated joy of enjoying something so
      thoroughly, not to the point of escapism, but rather self-reflection. I’m
      recommending watching something and loving it and thinking about why you
      love it so much and thinking about all of the parts of yourself that, put
      together, made you this person, consuming this media, and having fun."

    title02: Everything will hurt for a while by Ruth Awad
    desc02: There’s something so breathtaking about a poem beginning with “and.” I
      read this poem several weeks ago and am still thinking about the way the
      second stanza begins, too, with “listen”—we are halfway through, yet the
      speaker still asks this of us. And so I listen, and so I read again. The
      Shallow Ends consistently puts out some of my favorite poems by some of my
      favorite poets, helping me look forward to Thursdays which historically
      have been some of my most tiring days. I urge you to look through its
      archives, but spend some extra time with [this
      poem](http://www.theshallowends.com/home/everything-will-hurt-for-a-while) by
      Ruth Awad.

    title01: Kara Haupt’s goal tracking spreadsheet
    desc01: Kara is the absolute queen of spreadsheets, and my Virgo Rising envies
      her for it. Her latest masterpiece is [this 2019 goal tracking
      spreadsheet](https://twitter.com/karahaupt/status/1078442386886414337).
      It’s strict and specific enough to be motivating (you too can be the kind
      of person who reads one book every week!) and flexible enough not to be
      overwhelming—once you save a copy to your Google Drive, you can customize
      it however you want. I won’t disclose my own batch of 2019 goals (I need
      to have secrets) but I will say that doing this newsletter is one of them.

    title02: Haley Houseman’s rules for 2019
    desc02: "If you are unsure of where to start re: getting your life together in
      2019, [this twitter
      thread](https://twitter.com/hedhouseman/status/1078290356154847236) is
      full of good ideas. It starts with “get rid of all your uncomfortable
      underwear and bras in 2019! be free.” and ends with “fresh toothbrush for
      2019! it’s the little things that count!” and all of the advice that comes
      in-between is just as good. Read it through, pick out the gentle
      instructions you like the most, and pocket them away somewhere for when
      you have a spare minute."
