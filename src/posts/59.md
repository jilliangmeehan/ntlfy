  intro:
    topic: breakfast
    jillian: I’m not good at eating breakfast, most days. Like, I love eggs and
      bagels and bacon and toast and all that—I do! But I also love to sleep in
      late and then rush to start my day, and there is usually not enough time
      for breakfast in that routine. When I was still working on an office every
      day, I got into the habit of eating a Clif bar from the office snack stash
      every day while I made my tea in the morning. Once I started working from
      home because of the pandemic, I was on my own. Eventually I started buying
      Clif bars for myself, because even though I am bad at breakfast, I still
      need to eat something in the morning if I want to make it through the day.
      Yes, I could wake up earlier and learn how to slow down and enjoy some
      scrambled eggs first thing in the morning if I really tried. That sounds
      like it would be nice. For now, though, the best I can do most days is a
      protein bar with chocolate chips in it.
    summer: I’m not hungry when I wake up. I work better if I’m fed. These are two
      truths that often conflicted back in the days of going to a physical place
      that is not my bedroom to complete my job. I used to wake up, drink
      coffee, make more coffee, run to work, and crash very soon after, running
      only on caffeine and the anxiety of going from one place to the next
      before my hunger kicked in. Although breakfast is, allegedly, “the most
      important meal of the day” (this feels like some sort of American
      capitalist propaganda, idk man), it really always felt like something
      special rather than necessary. When I think of breakfast, I think of plans
      with friends—the effort and care put into waking up, giving ourselves time
      and space between this act and doing anything else, and then coming
      together to eat incredibly heavy, ridiculous amounts of food. I think of
      my family; Palestinian breakfasts are large, spanning many different
      plates—I do not like eggs but I will eat them on my mother’s breakfast
      table, alongside pickled turnips and labneh and fresh bread and olives and
      all of the other things people will make fun of me for writing poems
      about. Having breakfast means I am giving myself time and care and space.

    title01: Reading Sucks
    desc01: "[Melissa Lozada-Oliva’s
      newsletter](https://ellomelissa.substack.com/) is one of my favorite
      things. I “love reading” and based on this newsletter it can seem like I
      am an “avid” or “consistent” reader. While I can meet my pseudo-goals, I
      still carry a lot of guilt with reading, especially against the other ways
      I spend my time. Sometimes, I think, what could I have accomplished if
      instead of banking 50 hours on Ace Attorney in two weeks, I did 50 hours
      of reading? But this line of thinking simply is not productive. I worry
      about reading many books at once, or the time it takes me to finish
      something—this keeps me from reading long books—but reading Melissa’s
      newsletter has been really comforting for feeling kinship with someone who
      also is always trying, but actively acknowledging sometimes we do other
      things, sometimes our brains get in the way, and sometimes the world
      simply does not give us the space and attention for reading. [You can

    title02: Ergonomic Grip for Switch
    desc02: Unfortunately, I have pain literally everywhere, but I won’t let it stop
      me from gaming for six hours. There are games I like playing handheld more
      than docked, and so [this ergonomic
      grip](https://www.satisfye.com/products/zengrip-pro) for my Switch has
      been really helpful; there are a lot of different options, though, so shop
      around for what suits you. Just know it exists and your hands will love
      you for it!

    title01: Stickers
    desc01: I’ve talked about [using a planner](https://letterstosummer.com/56/) in
      this newsletter before, but I just recently started putting stickers in my
      planner every day to pretend I am one of those cute studygram accounts
      with adorable bullet journal spreads and it has brought me a lot of joy. I
      got a bunch of stickers from [Kawaii Pen
      Shop](https://letterstosummer.com/56/) recently, and I also get some
      from [Punimelt’s Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/punimelt/posts) every
      month, which I love and endorse very much. Get some stickers! Actually use
      them! Put them all over your stuff! It will make you happy!

    title02: Magic Spoon cereal
    desc02: I actually kind of hate myself for recommending trendy, DTC cereal, but
      since we’re on the topic of breakfast I gotta say that I have been eating
      and enjoying [this](https://magicspoon.com/) lately. I really like the
      cookies and cream flavor, and I really like that it has a lot of protein
      in it because I need that if I want to get through the day without feeling
      like death. This is pretty good stuff to have around for breakfast—or days
      when you really truly do not have the energy to make an actual meal for
      yourself.
