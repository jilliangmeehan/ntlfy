  intro:
    topic: dreams
    jillian: I don’t often remember my dreams, and when I do, they aren’t usually
      very weird. I tend to dream about pretty mundane things from my daily
      life—I’ve dreamed about work, I’ve dreamed about school, I’ve dreamed
      about hanging out with my friends. My favorite is when I spend a little
      too much time playing a video game, and then I just dream that I’m playing
      the video game. My dreams never seem to have any hidden meaning to them,
      which is sort of boring but mostly comforting. They’re just made up of
      bits and pieces of what I spend my time doing and thinking about.
      Sometimes all those little details add up into something confusing when
      you smash it all together—a house I visited once as a kid, my banking app,
      a group of strangers from the internet, a boyband member, various members
      of my family—but that’s the fun part of dreams, I guess.
    summer: Whenever I have a super freaky or vivid dream, I tell my friend Jess
      about it. She is an avid dream journaler, tarot reader, and general
      spiritual-witchy kind of gal, and she helps me make sense of them. When I
      have a vivid dream, I do want it to mean something. I have a lot of
      nightmares, especially when my anxiety is higher, and I’ve seen some
      pretty disturbing shit? but my favorite dreams are the simple weird ones.
      Once, I dreamed there was a giraffe in my living room that was so, so
      tiny, but had a sliding door looking out to a spooky patio. I’m an
      overthinker, I’m a represser, etc etc—I do see dreams as a way of
      signifying things I cannot ignore.

    desc01: "[This Japanese Breakfast
      album](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ajoNtBO6xHfWEkORtRCAv) is so good!
      I hadn’t really listened to them much (her? I guess it’s a band?) before
      this release but I’m hooked, I’m a fan, I’m ready to go."

      treat! I made the inaugural [layali

      whipped cream and pistachios."

    title01: Discord
    desc01: "I thought somehow, for sure, I must have already
      recommended [Discord](https://discord.com/) at some point in this
      newsletter. I use it every day! But apparently not, so let me correct
      that: I probably don’t need to tell anyone what Discord is at this point,
      but I would at least like to advocate for joining or making a little
      server with a few of your friends (and friends of friends) so you can have
      a space to hang out and chat about your day, talk about shared interests
      in dedicated channels, and maybe chill on voice chat and listen to music
      together while you work. Discord has kinda become my preferred way to
      interact with people in different online communities lately, and I’m
      really glad it exists."

    title02: Pâtisserie Snail
    desc02: I’m listening to [this new Snail’s House
      EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/0Otl8v7z2q6j7Lx3PWUzHi?si=I3VuUtmORgmHLk1AvTYxkQ&dl_branch=1) while
      l write this and I love it. It’s just fun and cute and all the songs are
      named after baked goods, which is basically all I want out of music. Put
      it on while you work to feel like you’re a lil pixel character in a video
      game who’s advancing levels by answering emails.
