  intro:
    topic: patience
    jillian: In the mornings, I get myself out of bed and into the kitchen, and I
      turn on the electric kettle to heat up some water, and while the water is
      heating up I put a small tea strainer into a big mug, and then I pour the
      hot water over it and I set a timer and wait for the tea to brew for five
      minutes. And every morning, I know it will take just five minutes. And I
      know that when the five minutes is up, I’ll have a cup of tea to drink,
      and I’ll be able to start my day. I am not patient, because to be patient,
      you have to be ok with waiting for things that are out of your control,
      and I have a hard time with things that are out of my control. To be
      patient, you have to be ok with not knowing how things will turn out, and
      I have a hard time with not knowing how things will turn out. (Are we
      seeing a pattern here?) I think it is good, if you are an impatient and
      anxious person like me, to have some things in your life that you can
      count on, that you know will be there for you on a certain or at a certain
      time or in a certain place—things that you don’t need to wait for. I am
      not patient and I don’t know how to be, but I know that in five minutes,
      my tea will be ready, and that comforts me.
    summer: "I am impatient, I am anxious, I do not like waiting for things; I am
      always way too early or running late and barely have a concept of how much
      time has passed. I’ve only begun to focus on managing this in the last two
      years, and my first step was mastering caramelizing onions. [Helen
      Rosner](https://twitter.com/hels) tweeted once about how all recipes lie
      to you about how long it takes to caramelize onions. They do! I felt dumb!
      But they were just lying! In the summer of 2018, I became obsessed with
      putting them in everything. I didn’t realize, at first, they would take
      upwards of an hour to cook, and any impatience in their cooking (bumping
      up the temperature) would basically lead to burnt onions, instead. But I
      did it, to varying degrees of success: notably, a quiche I made for a
      Bachelor in Paradise viewing, had a chorus of “oh, Summer, these onions
      kind of taste caramelized.” The true first success, though, was when I had
      a friend coming over to make a meal, had very little else to do
      beforehand, and just started prepping; I chopped onions, and there was an
      hour before they would arrive. I put them on the stove. I had no rush, and
      so I didn’t need them to be caramel-y sooner. The final meal tasted
      fantastic. I’ve caramelized onions dozens of times since, some times
      better than others. A lot of my anxiety comes from thinking I do not have
      enough time left. I want to learn to give myself that time."

    title01: Capable Monsters by Marlin M. Jenkins
    desc01: There are two things I love—Pokemon and poems—so as you’d expect, this
      chapbook is perfect for me. [Marlin](https://twitter.com/Marlin_Poet) does
      such a good job at capturing something important to a lot of people,
      emotionally/mentally/sentimentally (Pokemon) and unraveling its smallest
      parts into these beautiful reflections that communicate just *why it hits
      so hard.* I am a big fan of anything that takes something maybe a little
      silly and lovingly, enchantingly expands on the ways it contributes to our
      healing. [Buy this book from Bull
      City](https://bullcitypress.com/product/capable-monsters-by-marlin-m-jenkins/).

    title02: Theme Park Trash
    desc02: "I spent a lot of my childhood in Southern California, about 30 minutes
      from Disneyland, Universal Studios, Knotts’ Berry Farm, etc. etc. I knew
      theme park people, I wanted to be theme park people, I could have been
      theme park people if I’d had a driver’s license, and listen: Miya and
      Rosie are the best kind! They juggle that loving nostalgia and present
      romanticizing of places like Disneyland with the absolute full knowledge
      that yes, theme parks are sort of a capitalistic nightmare! Buuuuuut
      they’re really fun, and we can give ourselves that! Each episode, they
      discuss topics or imagine scenarios related to theme parks—like designing
      a new ride for Harry Potter World, or planning a perfect Disneyland date.
      Miya and Rosie are really fucking funny and also incredibly
      brilliant—listen to
      them [here](https://open.spotify.com/show/3j5OKiJ2r5PUideL79YfNL). I’d
      recommend starting with one of their recent episodes, “[Writing a Mickey
      Mouse Movie](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ydZAXqUtRvjnPotY9BRA6).”"

    title01: Threads
    desc01: I don’t know why I didn’t know [this
      app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-from-instagram/id1473867767) existed
      until last week, but I have been using it religiously since I first
      downloaded it. Threads is an app from Instagram just for DMs with the
      people on your Close Friends list—that’s literally it. It’s great. I have
      been trying to spend less time on Instagram because (wow!) it sometimes
      makes me feel bad and I don’t like that, but it’s hard to limit your time
      on an app that plays a big part in how you communicate with the people
      you’re close to. Using Threads to separate my daily DMs from the rest of
      Instagram has been huge for me, and I definitely recommend it to anyone
      else who is tired of opening Instagram 80 times a day but still wants to
      send selfies with silly filters on them to their friends..
