  intro:
    jillian: Somehow, Virgo season is having the opposite effect on me. The only
      thing I want to do is lay in bed and watch Sailor Moon for hours, sorry!
      That said, I’m really excited about some of the things I’ve been working
      on lately—and I can’t wait to share them with you soon.
    summer: Virgo season is really doing it for me. I’ve been packing a lunch and
      making dinner for myself everyday, cleaning on the weekends, and there
      have been other happy things in my life besides Fire Emblem. It’s cool.

    title01: Kingdom Animalia by Aracelis Girmay
    desc01: I’ve been screaming about this book to anyone who will listen since I
      read it earlier this summer. I just reread it this past week & it remains
      stunning, stunning, stunning. Aracelis Girmay has a powerful hold on
      language, specifically, I am obsessed with her syntax?! Literally I am
      never more in awe with the way someone arranges a sentence than her. You
      can read one of my favorite poems from the
      collection [here](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56717/st-elizabeth) and
      buy
      it [here](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780140559965?aff=PublishersWeekly)!

    title02: "What’s Inside: Songs from Waitress"
    desc02: I’ve been baking a lot more than I ever have, which means I’ve been
      listening to “What’s Inside” an INCREDIBLE amount. This is Sara
      Bareilles’s concept album for the musical Waitress. I love the original
      cast recording, but this version is mellower, gentler, and there’s really
      nothing better than Sara Bareilles harmonizing “sugar, butter, flour” with
      herself as you mix ingredients together. Listen to it
      on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1s6codM2ZAB008t9GTyaEk?si=NycrgRtvQwaS6PM5IC_1EA).

    title01: XOXO
    desc01: Last weekend, I went to Portland for [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/), an
      annual conference that I love very much but that is very hard to put into
      words. XOXO is for people who make stuff and people who like the stuff
      that people make. It’s three days of fun and inspiring talks, game demos,
      live podcast tapings, karaoke, and getting to know people in a creative
      and welcoming community. If you have the opportunity, go.

    title02: Dark Noise
    desc02: When I was in college, I used an app
      called [Coffitivity](https://coffitivity.com/) to help me focus while I
      wrote my assignments. Something about the jumbled, warm sounds of a
      typical coffee shop atmosphere helped me get in the mood and get my work
      done without distractions. Today, I’m using [the new Dark Noise
      app](https://darknoise.app/), which has a coffee shop soundscape that
      reminds me of Coffitivity, along with plenty of other noises like
      rainwater, waves crashing on a beach, and plain old white noise. It’s
      simple, feels nice to use, and helps me get stuff done when my brain just
      doesn’t want to work.
