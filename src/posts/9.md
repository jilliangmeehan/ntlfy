  intro:
    jillian: "I’m having a week that can best be described as “brain machine
      broken.” Turns out even when you feel like you’re doing everything
      right—getting enough sleep, drinking water, doing yoga, meditating,
      etc.—you can still feel shitty! Big giant recommendation this week: take a
      day off from being a person, forgive your brain for being stupid, and
      resolve to try again tomorrow."
    summer: Happy Mid-March everyone! My mom’s birthday is on Saturday and I would
      like everyone to watch a Turkish drama in her honor. In other news, I was
      included in this article on “[Recognizing Under-Known Arab Americans this
      Women’s History
      Month](https://www.arabamerica.com/recognizing-under-known-arab-americans-this-womens-history-month/)”
      and I just feel very validated that yes, fame? She’s on her way.

    title01: 47SOUL
    desc01: Since they are playing in San Francisco the day before this letter comes
      out and I won’t be seeing them (yet again, evening commitments keep me
      from concerts), let me tell you about a band I love! My cousin Eli
      recommended them to
      me—[47SOUL](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5nxFmhSekt9Acn4tWZxGge?autoplay=true&v=A) is
      an electro-dabke music group made up of members from various parts of the
      Palestinian diaspora. They sing in English and Arabic, so even if you have
      no familiarity with the language, you can still bounce around and
      understand some of the words!

    title02: Captain Marvel
    desc02: "Kamala Khan’s first appearance in the Marvel universe was in Captain
      Marvel #13 (in 2013), at the very end of the issue. She puts up a poster
      of Carol Danvers, and I started weeping immediately. There, I
      realized, *tight, comics are going to make me cry as much as anything
      else*. Carol Danvers is my second favorite hero in the Marvel world; this
      is partly because she is the hero of my first favorite character, and
      partly because of the incredible writing by Kelly-Sue Deconnick. [The
      movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154664/) was everything I needed it
      to be; the structure allowed a two-fold origin story—we learn how Carol
      gets her powers, but we also learn how she will be relevant to the films
      at hand, no time is wasted. She is strong and goofy, and I finally
      understood male power fantasies because when she fought I was like, *oh I
      wanna do that too*. I cried a lot! It was great!"

    title01: Jour
    desc01: If you’ve read this newsletter even like, once, you know that I recently
      started going to therapy and that meditation is my new hobby.
      “Mindfulness” is a messy buzzword, but there truly is something so nice
      about just…taking a few minutes to stop working and actually think about
      how you’re feeling. Who knew! [This journaling
      app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jour-guided-journaling/id1439590239) that
      just launched is my new favorite way to do that.

    title02: A big, fluffy pillow
    desc02: I’m a big supporter of having many pillows on my bed (four at the
      absolute minimum)—so naturally I just bought a new one. [This
      pillow](https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/amped-fleece-oversized-pillow?category=decorative-pillows-throw-blankets&color=016&quantity=1&size=26X26&type=REGULAR) is
      huge and soft and fluffy and beyond comforting. It’s probably the next
      best thing to having a pet to cuddle with every night.
