  intro:
    topic: reading
    jillian: My mom likes to tell people that I taught myself how to read as a kid.
      I don’t really know what that means, or remember, but I know that I always
      loved reading books when I was younger. I read all the time—including when
      I wasn’t supposed to, like late at night when I was supposed to be
      sleeping, or in class when I was supposed to be paying attention to the
      teacher. As an adult, I don’t read novels as much. There’s too much else
      to do, and I find it a lot harder to convince myself to spend time with a
      new book. But that doesn’t mean I don’t still love *reading*—I’m just
      reading other things. I’ve gotten better at accepting the fact that
      reading fanfiction counts as reading. Reading manga counts as reading.
      Reading someone’s newsletter counts as reading. Reading magazine articles
      counts as reading. Reading for five minutes a day because that’s all I can
      convince myself to squeeze in is *still* reading! It still counts! It’s
      better than nothing at all, and it brings me joy! So while I’m not the
      same kind of reader I was as a kid, I don’t want to say that I’m not as
      “good” at reading or that I don’t enjoy it as much now—because I still am,
      and I still do.
    summer: I am a lot of things—a gamer, allegedly a writer, an editor, a former
      theater kid, a former choir kid, and very good at watching lots and lots
      of television. First and foremost, though, I like to identify as a
      reader—from how I approach my writing, my editing, my general hobbies,
      reading comes first. Reading is harder to do, a lot of the time, than
      staring mindlessly at my timeline while a TV show plays in the background,
      but it really is the most satisfying activity when I can get into it.
      There are a lot of times I come out of a book thinking *god I just love
      reading,* which like, yes, we get it, I’m a nerd! I’m trying to remind
      myself it’s still reading if there’s no ISBN attached. I love reading my
      friends’ unpublished manuscripts, I love reading fanfiction, I love
      reading the discourse article of the week (truly, honestly). I feel most
      alive when I’m on a reading kick. A perfect afternoon is one where I have
      no headache, the light is just right, I have two new poetry collections to
      dig into, and many many hours to do nothing but that.

    title01: Chocolate chip banana cookies
    desc01: I had some super-ripe bananas and wasn’t excited by the prospect of
      making banana bread, so I did a little searching and found…[banana
      cookies](https://www.momontimeout.com/chocolate-chip-banana-cookies/)!
      These are SO delicious, the inside is wonderful and when warm just MOLTEN
      and good??? They can easily be vegan if you want and use no eggs. I
      suggest pressing them down a little bit before baking. The amount of
      banana is very forgiving. The raw dough is also very good, but I have
      recently learned you’re not supposed to eat raw flour….so!

    title02: Gumbo Ya Ya
    desc02: "[Aurielle Marie’s debut poetry
      collection](https://upittpress.org/books/9780822966661/) is actually my #1
      book of the year. I might have said that about many books released in
      2021, but holy shit dude! I mean it this time. Every single poem carries
      this ridiculously compelling rush of momentum—I read it slow and savored
      every little detail. No moment was out of place. Every word served the
      next. From the cover to the interior design, this book is also an art
      object, oh my god! What a spectacular package to complement the incredible
      work within. Highly highly highly recommend!"

    title01: Peachtober
    desc01: "[Peachtober](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTV00msPiJ9/) is an October
      art prompt list created by [Sha’an
      d’Anthes](https://www.instagram.com/furrylittlepeach/), and I think it’s
      so cute! Every October there are a bunch of art prompts that float around,
      but this is my favorite this year. I haven’t made art every day, because I
      just don’t have the energy for that, but I’ve really enjoyed seeing art
      undert the #peachtober2021 tag on Instagram and Twitter—and on the
      official [Peachtober](https://www.instagram.com/peachtober/) account."

    title02: Butterberry Cafe
    desc02: Giuseppe of Butterberry Cafe has been one of my favorite artists this
      past year. They make adorable pixel art badges and emotes (I got some to
      use on Twitch and I love them) that are available in
      their [shop](https://ko-fi.com/butterberrycafe), and they share all of
      their art on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/butterberrycafe). Seeing new
      pixel art from them always makes me so happy.
