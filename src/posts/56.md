  intro:
    topic: starting over
    jillian: "I just moved into a new apartment a little over a week ago, which is
      always a weird and exciting and stressful experience. I’m in a new
      neighborhood, living on my own for the first time in my life, moving all
      the furniture around to see what feels right. Starting over is fun, but
      it’s also a little bit scary—so I find comfort in the things in my life
      that have *not* changed. Things like blankets and plants and cups of pens
      that I brought over from my last place. Things like video games that I
      feel like I could play forever (I just started playing Fire Emblem: Three
      Houses again). Things like TV shows and movies that I’ve already seen a
      billion times and love to rewatch. That’s a different kind of starting
      over, one that never changes and keeps me feeling steady."
    summer: "I have a lot of unfinished notebooks. Some of them are for specific
      uses: a notebook to practice my Arabic in, a notebook to write recipes in,
      a notebook for my work-to-dos. I have a poetry notebook, an essays
      notebook that’s sometimes a poetry notebook but also sometimes a personal
      to-do list, a notebook to write about the books I read—on & on & on. I
      want to just *finish them* so I can buy another & start fresh. I love the
      possibilities of a new notebook but treat them far too preciously. I
      struggle with clean-slates, with starting over; this manifests so minorly
      in my Animal Crossing House, my rooms haphazardly built throughout the
      months with furniture I had at the time & struggle to switch out, building
      instead of shaping. I want to! I want my brain to be clean, smooth, to
      build itself back up."

    title01: The Limits of the Lunchbox Moment by Jaya Saxena
    desc01: Food writing is one of my favorite genres, but there’s often been a
      disconnect for me when I read the stories other children if immigrants
      write—specifically, the focus on the “lunchbox moment” in which a child of
      color is mocked for bringing their traditional food to school. There are
      an overwhelming number of factors that contribute to this being
      unrelatable to me, but I often felt frustrated by the lack of alternative
      stories in how food, especially at a young age, factors into racism and
      marginalization (as well as ignoring broader issues such as access and
      colonialism). [This
      piece](https://www.eater.com/22239499/lunchbox-moment-pop-culture-tropes) unpacks
      the “lunchbox moment” so, so well, featuring an array of conversations
      with people of color talking about their relationship to the “moment,”
      food, and what their experiences genuinely looked like. The writer does
      something remarkable, as well, and talks about a piece she’d written in
      the past, examining where her claims had come from; did she simply forget
      something she had written about, or were the events manufactured, based on
      broader pressures in the industry? It’s a great piece of food writing, but
      also so productive for the more institutional ramifications of shallow
      identity politics.

    title02: Lolita Podcast
    desc02: I’ve recommended Jamie Loftus’s work a few times on this newsletter—she
      is simply my favorite comedian—but [this
      podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/4dvc06zTAaAylzdTrsgKzp) is a little
      different; in it, she explores the cultural legacy of
      Nabokov’s *Lolita* through the (awful) film adaptations, the fashion
      culture, the way references appear (poorly) in the zeitgeist, in music;
      it’s an impeccable piece of scholarship and journalism. In my years as an
      English Major™, I don’t think I ever encountered a research question
      approached with such thorough care. I learned SO MUCH, leaving the series
      equal levels grateful & horrified. BIG MAJOR TRIGGER WARNINGS for
      discussions of child sexual assault, pedophilia, and rape. I had to listen
      to each episode in pieces, so make sure you take your time. Find it
      wherever you listen to podcasts!

    title01: Hobonichi planner
    desc01: I’ve never been good at using planners, but [this
      one](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2021/pc/detail_cover/cb21_jan/) was
      an impulse buy last year when I started working from home and I’ve loved
      it ever since. I don’t know if it makes me more productive or more
      organized than before, but I really enjoy taking the time to fill out my
      schedule every week, and I do think it’s helpful to keep open in front of
      me while I work so I can jot down notes to myself and things I need to do.
      JetPens has a
      helpful [guide](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/guide-to-the-hobonichi-techo-planner/pt/900) to
      the Hobonichi lineup that can help you choose one that suits your needs—I
      like the A5 Cousin because of the big daily pages, personally.

    title02: Shower eucalyptus
    desc02: One of the first things I did when I moved into my new apartment (before
      I even finished fully unpacking) was get a bundle of eucalyptus from a
      bodega down the street and tie it to my showerhead. Eucalyptus is great!
      It looks nice and smells nice and putting it in your shower is a really
      simple thing you can do to make the whole bathroom feel a little nicer.
      Look for it at your local bodega, grocery store, or flower shop.
