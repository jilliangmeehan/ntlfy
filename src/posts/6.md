  intro:
    jillian: I moved into a new apartment!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am very happy about this.
      I am also very, very tired. Moving is exhausting and my whole body hurts
      from carrying furniture. Also I accidentally ordered shot glasses from
      IKEA because I thought they were going to be bigger. There are pros and
      cons to this.
    summer: I started my last semester of undergrad! It is stressful! I am sad! In
      other news, [I might be making a zine for writers who cannot
      drive](https://twitter.com/summabis/status/1089638974723780608). Stay

    title01: Breath of the Wild
    desc01: A million things have been said about how incredible [this
      game](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/) is, how it’s the best of
      the Zelda franchise, how it’s revolutionary for Nintendo—and it is! The
      open world is amazing, but what really pulls me in (not surprisingly)
      is…the writing? The story? It’s like, video games are just another medium
      in which we can tell stories??? Amazing! This I have always known, but
      what’s really fucking cool about Breath of the Wild is the levels of
      investment it allows you. Gathering the memories is not required by any
      means—I googled “reward for finding memories?” and all of the message
      boards said “the plot lol”—which is good enough for me. It’s this really
      cool way to feel close to the character you’re embodying, to feel close to
      the world you’re fighting for. I’ve never really found cut-scenes a
      bother, but I know others have; here, you build your own awareness of what
      the point of everything is. It’s weird and beautiful and I am probably at
      100+ hours played and still haven’t beaten the game. Please borrow a
      Switch today.

    title02: The poetry of Jess Rizkallah
    desc02: I am in my last semester of college and almost every night since
      December 15 has been full of spirals. I have been going through an intense
      catalogue of all of the pieces of media that have gone into making
      me *me*, in all of the good or bad ways. Poetry is the biggest on my radar
      right now and Twitter has allowed me access I never thought I could have
      this early on. When I first started getting into spoken word, I searched
      “arab slam poet” on YouTube and found one of Jess’s videos, and I was
      like, *WOW, I cannot wait to be like her*. And now she is my FRIEND. And
      her being my friend does not stop me from being constantly in awe of how
      AMAZING SHE IS at the unraveling of images straight into the deep feeling
      in your gut that you’re working toward explicating every time a poem hits
      you. I am always sitting mouth-open, almost always in tears, covered all
      over in goosebumps when I read her work. You can buy her
      book [here](https://www.uapress.com/product/the-magic-my-body-becomes/) and
      check out her other work [here](https://www.jessrizkallah.com/).

    title01: Streaks
    desc01: As you may remember from past letters, I set a bunch of goals at the
      beginning of this year (drink more water, do more yoga, eat more salads,
      etc etc etc). I don’t know about you, but I am definitely the kind of
      person who needs help setting and meeting goals, and my *favorite* way to
      trick myself into doing things is to use apps. I’ve tried a bunch, but I
      always return to [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com/). It straddles the line
      between being v. customizable and being v. easy to use extremely well, and
      it nags me exactly the right amount. My streak of eating a salad every
      week has lasted…exactly one week! So it’s going well.

    title02: That Jenny Slate interview
    desc02: Have you read it yet? [This
      one](https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/jenny-slate-interview-the-sunlight-night-at-sundance.html).
      I cherish every Jenny Slate interview because, as she says, “When people
      interview me, it’s like I’m talking to a therapist.” She is honest and
      funny and kind and gentle, and everything she says makes me happy-cry. My
      favorite moment (of many) from this interview from Sundance is when she
      answers the question *What do you think changed for you?* “I think I
      stopped asking for other people to fill in the ridges of loneliness that I
      have inside of me.”
