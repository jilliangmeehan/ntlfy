  intro:
    jillian: This is a very exciting week for me, because something I’ve been
      working on for months has finally been put out into the world, and I’m so
      so so so happy with it. [Give with us](https://givewith.us/) is a website
      I put together for shoppers to connect with people who are donating money
      they get from affiliate links to different organizations every month.
      Please take a look + share if you love me!!!
    summer: I am on my last spring break ever! Spending it writing my thesis,
      memorizing poems, and playing the My Hero Academia video game. I have some
      poems coming out this weekend, so keep an eye out on Twitter!

    title01: Hozier Covers
    desc01: "YES, Hozier just came out with a new album, YES I am listening to it a
      lot, BUT hear me out: covers are really, really fun. When I saw him in
      Oakland in October of last year, his encore song was “Say My Name,” which
      you can now listen to
      on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/2xbuycY0MolcTZGENc4PuK?si=L3h\
      ndwrxRIaTVZSJF_PiMQ) and I’d never felt such a strong sense of endearment.
      BBC Radio did a live lounge session with him where he sang “Do I Wanna
      Know” by Arctic Monkeys and honestly? I’ve ascended! Check out a playlist
      of his
      covers [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSIfogNf6oAgn_mJl1C8\
      7S6QifgWs6oc9). (Definitely want to flag the cover of “We Are Young” as
      well!)"

    title02: Say More
    desc02: This podcast, hosted by poets Melissa-Lozada Oliva & Olivia Gatwood, is
      basically if you recorded your conversations with your best friend, with
      the caveat that you and your friend are actually as witty and eloquent as
      you think you are. I love their poems & I love their fun. [Listen

    title01: Your podcast recommendations
    desc01: I recently did a tweet asking for podcast recommendations, because I
      realized that so many of the podcasts I listen to are hosted by men and I
      wanted to fix that. [This
      thread](https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1106256926126600192) is
      full of incredible recommendations for women-hosted podcasts, several of
      which I’m already in love with.

    title02: Laustrology
    desc02: My beautiful and talented friend Laura just launched her [astrology
      website](https://laustrology.com/)! I’ve been bugging her to let me work
      on this with her forever, it feels like (ever since she wrote horoscopes
      for my college magazine a few years ago) and I’m so happy with the way it
      turned out. Read her love letter to Aries
      season [here](https://laustrology.com/aries).
