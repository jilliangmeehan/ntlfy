  intro:
    jillian: "Hi, it’s me. Can anyone even hear me under all of the side projects
      I’m currently drowning in? Nope, I didn’t think so. But actually: things
      are going well, I’m working on a lot of things, I’m very excited about
      it."
    summer: It’s my second week of work as an editorial assistant! It’s cool! I have
      a job! I moved into a new apartment! I got a library card! Life is looking
      up.

    title01: Jourdain Searles
    desc01: "Jourdain is my favorite film critic! It’s her birthday this week, so I
      thought I would make sure you’re all reading her. I first found her work
      on *BitchMedia*, specifically a piece on [Tessa Thompson’s character
      in *Sorry to Bother
      You*](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/Sorry-to-Bother-You/Detroit-symb\
      olic-disrupter-anti-capitalism). It was an incredible, insightful
      criticism of the failure of the film to transform her from symbol to
      person. What struck me was how kind it was—maybe more than was deserved?
      She also hosts a podcast with Bronwyn Isaac called [Bad
      Romance](https://badromance.libsyn.com/), dissecting my favorite genre:
      shitty romance movies! Jourdan is brilliant and hilarious. [Follow her on
      Twitter](https://twitter.com/jourdayen) to see more of her work!"

    title02: Reem’s Muhammara Recipe
    desc02: "There is nothing that connects me to my Palestinian identity more than
      food. I am fluent in Kitchen Arabic, every poem I write has a scene of
      food being eaten, I am never more righteously angry than when someone
      calls hummus “Israeli.” In college, I was separated from my main source of
      that identity: my family, specifically my mom’s cooking. Going to Reem’s,
      a Palestinian-Syrian restaurant in Oakland, helped make me
      feel *home* more than anything else in the bay. Every bite is a poem. If
      you visit me, I will take you there and pay for our meal, as a good Arab
      does. One of my favorite things there is the muhammara. It’s not something
      my mom ever really made since it’s more Syrian, so my devotion is born
      solely out of that first bite I had at Reem’s; honestly, truly, religious.
      My mode of prayer is dipping bread into olive oil, hummus,
      muhammara—anything delicious and like home. Check out the
      recipe [here](https://www.aramcoworld.com/Articles/July-2019/Flavors-Reem\

    title01: Carly Rae Jepsen
    desc01: I went to a Carly Rae Jepsen show last night and am still trying to find
      the words to describe how great it was. I’ve loved CRJ’s music
      since [E•MO•TION](https://open.spotify.com/album/6UjZgFbK6CQptu8aOobzPV),
      and getting the chance to dance and scream and sing along to some of my
      favorites from that album (+ [Side
      B](https://open.spotify.com/album/31776n0a6xHYMHSlK4983u)!
      + [Dedicated](https://open.spotify.com/album/25it7uSpNFuRoD6uNc0Tfu),
      which is equally perfect!) was magical. If you are ever able to see CRJ
      live, make it happen.

    title02: Bontemps Pu’erh tea
    desc02: "Every morning when I get to work, the first thing I do is heat up some
      water for tea. The second thing I do is sit down at my desk for 45 minutes
      and completely forget about the tea. (Who can relate?) My morning beverage
      of choice for the past few months has been [this very delicious Pu’erh
      tea](https://shopbontemps.com/collections/featured/products/puerh) with
      oat milk. Some cool things about Bontemps tea: it’s organic, 100%
      pesticide-free, and the company [uses some of the profits to
      invest](https://shopbontemps.com/pages/campaign) in creative women and
      nonbinary folks. Sounds good to me!"
