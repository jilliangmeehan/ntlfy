  intro:
    jillian: Happy Valentineâ€™s Day! This time last year I was watching Gone Girl
      alone in my bed that I was subletting from a stranger in Crown Heights.
      Honestly? It was great. Hope youâ€™re all being nice to yourselves today.
    summer: Itâ€™s halfway through February, which means the deadline for my poetry
      slam team to raise money for our crowdfunder is almost here!Â [Please,
      please donate](https://crowdfund.berkeley.edu/project/13578). We wanna do
      poems in Houston. Also, I was on TWO PODCASTS!
      ListenÂ [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dirty-pinko-commie/id1448981303)Â andÂ [here](https://thequeerarabs.com/podcast/episode-49-palestine-poetry-pokemon-with-summer/).
      I love to talk!

    title01: Panic! At the Disco Live In Chicago
    desc01: Okay, I know itâ€™s 2019 and this is a ridiculous recommendation, but I
      still love Panic! just as much as I did eleven years ago. I was revisiting
      this live album and thinking about how sad I am I never got to see them in
      concert, and how sad I am that Brendon Urie will be in Oakland soon but I
      also wonâ€™t get to see him. But itâ€™s okay! I can listen to Pretty. Odd. and
      cry just the same. You can listen to itÂ [on
      Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2zuVGxuEzVhhRHNS2ZeRja?si=17kAcDcVTtanIZi6AYYHvw).

    title02: One Day at a Time
    desc02: I love comedy that makes me cry! The \[third season] came out about a
      week ago and I, for once, didnâ€™t binge the entire thing in an evening. I
      gave it a few days, drawing out my tears across many 1AMs. God bless a
      truly updated sitcom. Comedy grounded in love. Cheesey, episodic lessons
      with nuanced takes on shit that hurts. The episode about anxiety attacks
      fucked me up in particularâ€“I wonâ€™t do too many spoilers but itâ€™s really
      nice to see parents commiserating with their children about mental
      illness.

    title01: Kacey Musgraves
    desc01: I shouldnâ€™t even have to make this recommendation!!!!!! Iâ€™m sure you all
      know this by now!!!! Anyway, I didnâ€™t watch the Grammys, but they were
      right about Kacey Musgraves. Her albumÂ [Golden
      Hour](https://open.spotify.com/album/7f6xPqyaolTiziKf5R5Z0c)Â has brought
      me so much joy this year. I return to it again and again, and itâ€™s always
      just as good as the first time I heard it.

    title02: Griefbacon
    desc02: I truly canâ€™t believe itâ€™s taken me this long to talk
      aboutÂ [Griefbacon](https://griefbacon.substack.com/). What is wrong with
      me? Griefbacon is the best newsletter on the internet (aside from this
      one, duh). Iâ€™ve been subscribed since the very beginning, and I still get
      excited when a new letter lands in my inbox. Helena is a gorgeous writer,
      and her words have made me cry on more than one occasion, which is really
      the highest praise I can give anything. The free version of Griefbacon is
      great, but if you can spare $5/month, itâ€™s well worth signing up for the
      paid subscription.
