  intro:
    topic: Fridays
    jillian: Fridays have become very different for me in the past few months,
      because my company introduced a four-day workweek (very very very good).
      At first, I took every new Friday off to just do nothing, to just rest. To
      be lazy and play video games for hours and ignore all my responsibilities.
      Because I needed it! But it’s hard, I think, to detach yourself from the
      idea that weekdays—including Friday—are for working. So I’ve since fallen
      into a routine where I get up at the same time I get up for work the rest
      of the week and try to accomplish a few chores or personal tasks at least,
      while still taking the day slowly and giving myself plenty of time for
      rest and “fun” stuff.
    summer: There is an incredible relief in my body when I reach the end of the
      week; there is something sleepy and lethargic about Fridays, even if I
      have an immense amount to do. When my Fridays are busy are when I am the
      most exhausted the day after. Sometimes I think my body sort of holds onto
      the manifestation of exhaustion—I don’t get the aches/pains/agonies until
      I can really release them, which is Saturday (despite the many to-do lists
      I build for my weekends). There’s almost an allowance to myself for how I
      spend my evening, with no regards to consequence—because it’s Friday!

    title01: Language of Baklava
    desc01: My friend Samia read Diana Abu-Jaber’s *Crescent* last year and
      enthusiastically recommended her work to me; I remembered reading about
      her memoir *The Language of Baklava* back when I was writing my senior
      thesis. I had never thought to pick it up, for some reason, despite it
      literally being a food memoir by an Arab American until Samia’s
      encouragement, and oh my god! Fuck! Not only do I wish I had read this
      book four years ago, I ALSO wish I had read it ten years ago! It’s so fun
      and gorgeous and heart-warming; I’m going to attempt the recipes that
      bracket the end of each memory. I’m now completely devoted to Abu-Jaber
      and can’t wait to dive into the rest of her work. Buy
      it [here](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/363/the-language-of-baklava-by-diana-abu-jaber/)!

    title02: Abbott Elementary
    desc02: Quinta Brunson is showrunning this workplace mockumentary!!! It’s very
      funny and sweet and is sure to be the Next Big Sitcom, in my opinion. I
      love having something to look forward to weekly, also, feeling very retro
      by watching something on basic network television (ABC) and not binging
      it. Highly recommend! It airs Tuesday nights on ABC, or watch it
      on [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/abbott-elementary-7c33eeb2-5d16-4a10-ad9e-ee31f9fff15c) the
      next day.

    title01: Crash Landing on You
    desc01: I just finished watching [this
      kdrama](https://www.netflix.com/title/81159258) last week and it destroyed
      me so completely, in the best way. Like, fully ripped out my insides and
      chewed them up and spit them back out into my body and zipped me back up
      and swaddled me in a blanket and gave me a kiss on the forehead. I feel
      like a changed person!!! Watch if you like the agonizing slow burn of two
      people who are basically destined to be together but can’t be without
      facing a ton of obstacles.

    title02: Hatomori
    desc02: I’m a big fan of Yan’s art, so the second she opened [her
      shop](https://www.hatomori.art/) up I ordered a few stickers and prints
      that I’m really excited about! Go take a look and give her
      a [follow](https://twitter.com/hatomori_) for more cute cute cute stuff.
