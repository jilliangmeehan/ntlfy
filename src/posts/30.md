  intro:
    topic: procrastination
    jillian: "It’s incredibly appropriate that I waited until the very last minute
      to write this. Like, if you’re reading this right after it went up, I
      probably just finished writing this ten minutes ago. Even now, I am doing
      my very best to avoid writing this by doing other work instead. I would
      love to say that we draft this newsletter days before we send it out (and
      sometimes we do!) but more often than not we are scrambling to put it
      together the day of. You never stop procrastinating, even as an adult—even
      when the thing you are procrastinating is something like doing laundry or
      making plans with a friend you haven’t seen in a while, instead of the
      kinds of things you avoided doing in high school, like math homework and
      studying for finals. When I was a kid, I thought procrastinating meant I
      was lazy, or a bad student. I didn’t learn to recognize it as a symptom of
      anxiety until later. (And listen: sometimes it’s both. Sometimes I very
      much am just lazy.) The only thing I know for sure about procrastination
      is that it isn’t the big, scary monster it sometimes feels like; everyone
      procrastinates, it’s fine, we’re all fine, and it will feel so much better
      once you just do the thing you’re avoiding."
    summer: I’m very critical of myself, blame myself for a lot of things that are
      maybe not fault, suffer from depression—I’m not great at getting things
      done on time! Leaving school has given me a different perception of time,
      truly, and the types of tasks I put off, and why I’m putting them off;
      starting an assignment was always such a chore, but putting away my
      laundry is, too, deep-cleaning my room, grocery shopping, all of the
      above. Nothing is as bad if you just start. I create my own time and
      deadlines now, and instead of working towards a degree I’m working towards
      my health. I don’t want to put off cleaning my room because then the dust
      builds up and my lungs hurt, my lungs hurt and I don’t want to clean, the
      vicious cycle. I put off writing poems until I feel better. I end up doing
      almost nothing at all, mechanically going to work, coming home, brushing
      my teeth, going to bed. Procrastination means something different, less
      risking a grade and my sense of achievement and more something more
      severe, but I am doing it less. I am sticking to some schedules, following
      through in some ways. It feels better to know I can.

    title01: Hustlers
    desc01: I started this movie about ten minutes before the Golden Globes were
      over, feeling exhausted as I normally do while watching the Golden Globes.
      While the Oscars nominations didn’t fix that (Jennifer Lopez
      robbed! *Uncut Gems* robbed!), movies are still good! Halfway through, my
      roommate and I looked at each other and said, “Perhaps this is the best
      movie ever made? Perhaps, favorite film of all time?” The needle drops are
      magical, Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu are so fucking strong, the
      supporting cast is brilliant, and just throughout you feel the thriving
      competence! Motherhood is complex! Fuck the systems that harm you!
      Women!!!!! Oscar for Lorene Scafaria!!!! It’s available
      to [rent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT_ot9Lud4c) on a few streaming
      platforms, but I’m probably gonna go get the DVD to put into my
      non-existent DVD player.

    title02: My Year in Mensa
    desc02: I’ve recommended [Jamie
      Loftus’s](http://jamieloftusisinnocent.com/) work a few times on this
      letter, but here we go again! On January 1st she dropped a [4-episode
      podcast series](https://anchor.fm/jamie-loftus) about her year in the
      Smart People Club? Eugenics society? Mensa! It is, expectedly, hilarious,
      but it’s also a really interesting history, truly riveting because you
      fear for her safety, and a nice dive into *people who think differently
      than you* that, spoiler, doesn’t end with you being told to sympathize
      with people who want to cause you harm!

    title01: Pastel Nintendo Switch joycons
    desc01: This is a very tentative recommendation, because it involves voiding the
      warranty on your Switch, using tiny screwdrivers to take apart your
      joycons, messing with the tiny, fragile pieces that make the joycons work,
      and somehow putting it all back together again properly. [I did
      it](https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1216410858991116289), and it
      took two tries, but it turned out great and now I have a very cute, pastel
      Switch. Proceed with caution! Do your research! Find tutorials to follow
      along with! (And probably only do this if you have a backup pair of
      joycons, lbr.) Oh, and here are the [joycon
      shells](https://www.amazon.com/eXtremeRate-Handheld-Controller-Replacement-Nintendo/dp/B07NVLH8PR), [backplate](https://www.amazon.com/eXtremeRate-Nintendo-Switch-Handheld-Controller-Replacement/dp/B07NVMXNM8/ref=pd_sim_b2b_5/144-3376423-1654755?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07NVMXNM8&pd_rd_r=2676276a-9bfd-49b2-beb9-cc74e71d294a&pd_rd_w=95Hgh&pd_rd_wg=fM8QG&pf_rd_p=a07701e4-f565-442a-b97f-93ab23cbb7ef&pf_rd_r=8EDC70YF06AVQZMJCPYQ&psc=1&refRID=8EDC70YF06AVQZMJCPYQ), [joystick

    title02: Listening to Animal Crossing music while you work
    desc02: Or while you’re not working, whatever, that works too. [This
      website](http://tane.us/ac/) plays the Animal Crossing soundtracks from
      whichever version of the game you want on a constant loop, changing the
      music depending on the time. Personally, I prefer the original Gamecube
      soundtrack for maximum nostalgic vibes.
