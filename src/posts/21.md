  thread.

  intro:
    jillian: I have a few exciting things coming up! The first is that SNAX, a zine
      about snacks that I’ve been working on for close to two years, is finally
      being printed and will be available to buy very, very soon. The second is
      that I’m going to be at [XOXO](https://xoxofest.com/) next week! Say hi if
      you see me.
    summer: Hello friends! August is almost over and I am exhausted. I almost never
      want to socialize ever again but boy if there’s anything I am sure of,
      it’s that I am an introvert.

    title01: Chris Morocco Recreates Gordon Ramsay’s Beef Wellington
    desc01: As you may know, we’re big *Bon Appetit* fans on this newsletter. The
      relatively new series where Chris recreates things is actually my favorite
      (behind Claire, of course) and I realized more than once a week I get
      emotional about how wonderful it is to watch someone who is so technically
      skilled but is also an angel of a person. One time I read a YouTube
      comment that said Chris is the dream educator (kind and critical in a
      productive way), someone who reinvigorates you when things are
      difficult—this was in reference to his appearances on *Gourmet Makes*, but
      it sort of applies to his entire BA presence. I’m not in school anymore,
      which means I don’t have educators constantly letting me down anymore.
      I’ve just got Chris Morocco being really fucking cool and being able to
      tell that a piece of beef was seared before being baked in the oven just
      by touching it, and that’s truly the level of observation I want to carry
      with me in all things. Watch the
      episode [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eVMgUrEazA).

    title02: "Fire Emblem: Three Houses"
    desc02: "Yes I AM recommending one of the most popular video games currently
      out! I definitely have been doing other things! In case you are nervous
      about RPGs like I was, let me tell you: the actual battle gameplay in this
      game is streamlined to your tastes. If you like high strategy and risking
      the lives of your in-game team (terrible), you can do that. If you just
      like to have fun and treat fighting as an intermission to plot (cool), you
      can do that too. I described this game to my brother as an anime where the
      commercial breaks are chess, and honestly? It’s the best. The storylines
      are beautiful and complicated and all of the character designs are so
      lovely. Don’t get spoiled if you can. [Play it on the
      Switch](https://fireemblem.nintendo.com/three-houses/)!"

    title01: Anxiety Tech
    desc01: "Last week, I went to a one-day conference
      called [AnxietyTech](https://www.anxietytech.com/) that had talks and
      workshops covering all kinds of topics relating to mental health, mental
      illness, and self care in the tech industry—and I loved it. The bottom
      line is: we need to get better at how we approach and talk about mental
      health online, in our personal relationships, at work, and with ourselves.
      Step one is starting the conversation, and that’s what AnxietyTech is all
      about. I’m definitely going again next year, and I fully endorse checking
      it out. Maybe I’ll see you there?"

    title02: Glamorous habits
    desc02: Twitter is mostly bad, but [Twitter threads like this
      one](https://twitter.com/rachsyme/status/1164914549092442113?s=21) are
      extremely good. Rachel Syme asked people to share their “most glamorous
      hobby/trait/habit” and the replies are wonderful. It made me think a lot
      about the small ways we can take care of ourselves and make ourselves feel
      good, beyond the basics. (If you’re wondering, my most glamorous habit is
      lighting a candle every morning while I get ready to go to work.)
