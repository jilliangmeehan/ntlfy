  intro:
    topic: uncertainty
    jillian: "Back when going to bars and parties was a regular occurrence, I got
      anxious and easily irritated whenever my boyfriend invited me to go
      somewhere with him but didn’t give me a specific time or place well in
      advance. I hated the uncertainty of not knowing where the night was going,
      not having a clear plan. I hated feeling unprepared. Some people have no
      problem making casual plans and seeing where the night takes them; I am
      not one of those people. Calendar invites are my love language. That’s how
      uncertainty makes me feel on a small scale, so you can imagine what the
      uncertainty of, say, a global pandemic does to me—or even the uncertainty
      of what my life will look like in five years. I know this is an anxiety
      that will probably stick with me forever, on some level, but I’ve gotten a
      little bit better at dealing with it: recognizing what is actually within
      my control in the present moment, exercising control over those things in
      a healthy and helpful way, and learning to let go of the rest."
    summer: I’m anxious and impatient but not very good at making plans, and so
      generally, I don’t. Logistics stress me out. I’m not very fun, because of
      this, nor do I do very much, but most of my near-future is understood. So,
      naturally, the uncertainty of the pandemic is fucking me up. Choosing to
      create certainty for myself means deciding to be pessimistic (realistic?)
      about how to continue and how the virus will continue, too. My future is
      working from home, sanitizing all of my groceries (I know technically we
      don’t have to but read the first two words of this), and wearing a mask
      every time I go out. It also means being reluctant to look forward to
      anything; my partner and I used to see each other every month, but now
      airlines are deciding to book full flights? So no? We’re both in terrible
      outbreak states? Will TV happen anymore? I don’t want it to if it means
      people aren’t safe? I’m just a year past graduating and having that spiral
      of uncertainty, contending with it, figuring things out. All of that
      figure-outing has kind of dissolved, though. I guess I’m okay with not
      knowing but mostly because I don’t have a choice but to be resigned to it.
      At least everyone is sort of in the same boat.

    title01: Pose
    desc01: In the spirit of uncertainty, I’m going to recommend a show I haven’t
      finished yet. *POSE* on FX! I’ve consumed too much Ryan Murphy content
      this quarantine, but this show is definitely the best and has the least
      amount of frustrating trademarks of Ryan Murphy shows. It’s shot
      beautifully, the cast is stunning and talented, and there are hardly any
      white people in sight. :) When an episode is feel-good, I cry, when an
      episode is heart-wrenching, I cry, and if there’s anything I need during
      quarantine it’s honestly different emotional triggers besides “general
      despair and hopelessness.” Season 1 and 2 are both streaming on Netflix!

    title02: Apricot Season
    desc02: Truthfully, I’m not doing many new things these days, just playing the
      same video games, watching reruns of Food Network shows, and fucking
      around online until it’s time to sleep. Time is super warped in quarantine
      but you know what’s a beautiful marker? Seasonal fruits! Go buy apricots!
      They’re one of my main sources of joy these past few weeks! They are so
      little and far less messy than other stone fruit. A perfect snack. If
      you’re allergic I’m sorry! I’m gonna eat the last one in my fridge right
      now!

    title01: Punisher by Phoebe Bridgers
    desc01: Phoebe Bridgers is and will always be my sad girl queen, and she has
      a [new album](https://open.spotify.com/album/2xECuqnvvmVktV7UO8Dd3s) to
      help you lean into your sad girl-ness, too. I don’t know how to write
      about music and I always get nervous when I try, so I will just say that
      this album makes me *Feel Things™* in the best way. [Savior
      Complex](https://open.spotify.com/track/4BNew3AqFCvABdFsYMRiyB?si=SmZThXRySQ-4DXq0ku-UUQ) is
      my favorite song of the moment and I’m looking forward to seeing it at the
      top of my most-played list in my Spotify Rewind this year.

    title02: Quaranzine by Conveyor Studio
    desc02: "[Conveyor](https://conveyor.studio/shop/qz-subscription) is a very nice
      indie book studio, and they’re currently publishing a [six-part zine
      series](https://conveyor.studio/shop/qz-subscription) in collaboration
      with some cool creative folks. You can subscribe to get all six zines, or
      you can buy each one individually as they come out—and the profits are
      being donated to [NICE](https://www.nynice.org/) and [NYC Health +
      Hospitals](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/). I’ve gotten two of the
      zines so far, and I love them both."
