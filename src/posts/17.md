  intro:
    jillian: We’re back! And we have [100
      subscribers](https://twitter.com/jilliangmeehan/status/1143538801287077891?s=21)!
      Amazing. I am been on vacation, and it feels like I’ve been on vacation
      for years, so I’m actually pretty excited to get back to work the rest of
      the month (weird, I know). I’m really excited about a lot of the things
      I’m working on right now—hopefully I’ll have something big to share at the
      end of July.
    summer: Hi everyone! I write this letter weak of lung and strong of heart. June
      has been a big transition month in which I did basically nothing, but it’s
      July now! I’m sweatier but employed. There are a lot of things on the
      docket that will make the wait
      for [ACNH](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch/) much
      easier. I’m excited!

    title01: Good Omens on Amazon Prime
    desc01: Since December, I’ve been searching for the part of me that used to love
      things so deeply, the way I hadn’t since I was fifteen and very lonely. It
      was partly brought on by writing a thesis, which called for a care that I
      wasn’t sure I was able to muster anymore. Finding this care was helped
      by *My Hero Academia*, which [I’ve mentioned in a letter
      before](https://letterstosummer.substack.com/p/4-new-yr-new-us-missing-personal).
      I find myself fully capable of this love again with *Good Omens*. The book
      by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett was never a fandom I was particularly
      involved in, but I did consider it my favorite for brief moment—then, I
      read another book by Neil Gaiman and it became that one, etc., etc.
      Basically, I loved anything that man did. And he’s done it again!
      The [6-episode miniseries](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FMLSCTP/) is
      fucking incredible. It’s very funny, translating the satirical edge of the
      novel into campy visuals and sort of side-stepping interludes. The overall
      visuals are STUNNING and despite my fear of David Tennant for no other
      reason besides having to face my past, it’s really well-cast. Michael
      Sheen is possibly the most endearing man on the planet and I would die for
      Adria Arjona. I’ve watched it four times through already and wow! I will
      watch it a fifth! Unfortunately, I am telling you to go give Bezos money
      again. Sorry!

    title02: We’ve All Seen Helena by Lip Manegio
    desc02: This is the best chapbook I’ve ever read, maybe! I’m really drawn to
      poems that incorporate the love of celebrity or the way we’re drawn to
      idols & how we relate to and communicate that love, how we find ourselves
      in that love—that’s this book, baybee! It’s 26 pages of poems
      about/to/inspired by Gerard Way & My Chemical Romance that I
      fucking *blew* through in an hour and immediately went back to re-read
      several times. My favorite poem in particular is titled “gerard way finds
      my [fanfiction.net](http://fanfiction.net/) account”. You can buy it from
      Game Over
      Books [here](https://www.gameoverbooks.com/product-page/we-ve-all-seen-helena).

    title01: Animal Crossing Twitch streams
    desc01: "Playing Animal Crossing is great, but the second best thing is watching
      someone else play it. One of my favorite people on the internet, who goes
      by [@sailorhg](https://twitter.com/sailorhg?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwca\
      mp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), recently started doing daily streams of Animal
      Crossing: Happy Home Designer, which you can watch
      right [here](https://www.twitch.tv/sailor_hg). It is cute and fun and very
      calming."

    title02: Solid color avatars
    desc02: "Hear me out: instead of using photos of your friends in your phone
      contacts—or, ew, no avatar at all!—give each of your contacts a solid
      color avatar. If you pick colors that you love and that play well
      together, it will make your messaging experience so much nicer. I have an
      album in my photo library that’s just solid colors so I can easily assign
      one to everyone. It’s definitely a little bit of work, but it’s so worth
      it."
