  intro:
    topic: distraction
    jillian: I feel like I don’t know how to *not* multitask anymore. I don’t know
      how to just do one thing at a time, start to finish, before moving on to
      the next thing. I am always trying to do more than one thing, whenever
      possible—I read tweets while I watch TV, and then I have to rewind to see
      what I missed; I pick up my phone in between every chapter of a book; I
      start new video games before I’ve finished the old ones. Even while I’m
      writing this, I’m getting notifications that I desperately want to click
      on. I want to get up from my desk and lay on my bed and check Instagram,
      even though I just checked it. There’s always something new to be looking
      at. There’s always something new to occupy my mind. And if there isn’t,
      I’ll find something anyway. I’m working on setting boundaries, on putting
      my phone on the other side of the room when I don’t need it, on learning
      how to (maybe, slowly, barely) strengthen my attention span when every day
      is the same and mindless scrolling is an easy coping mechanism. Today, I
      meditated for 10 minutes at the beginning of the workday. Maybe tomorrow,
      I’ll stand in front of the tea kettle and wait for it to boil without
      wandering into another room to check my email.
    summer: "I’ve always had trouble focusing, on sitting still, on staying on one
      task. I’ve tried methods of blocking out time to devote myself to a single
      thing, but never kept the habit. I should be working on something else
      while writing this. Maybe you should be while reading it, too. I have a
      lot of difficulty deciphering between distraction and break — if I jump on
      Twitter after completing a task, isn’t it worth it to give my brain a
      moment of rest? But what if I was on Twitter all throughout the task? If I
      stamped the document I was meant to be working on each time I moved away
      from it, I’d never have a legible piece of work again. That might be the
      solution—creating a system of accountability with myself. What does
      distraction look like? There are two modes, to me: purposeful and
      compulsive. Sometimes the world is so bad and I simply want to not exist
      in it anymore, instead am desperately searching for something to keep my
      mind otherwise occupied. This is fine. Sometimes I am increasingly bored
      with what I must do—waiting for the kettle to boil, waiting for a website
      to load, waiting for an e-mail—and find myself completely away from
      intention an hour later. Yes, the water has cooled before I made tea, yes
      I had sixty new tabs open before the page was visible, yes I realized I
      had been sitting on my bed for nearly a half hour while people were
      waiting for me in the other room. These are not breaks. [Oh, to have
      someone deep-clean my brain with a vacuum as if I am an old Pikachu
      plush](https://twitter.com/pkmnshitpost/status/1258402286402969600?lang=e\
      n). Oh, to pick one task and complete it."

    title01: Search Party
    desc01: This show had been on my radar since it premiered in 2016, but I hadn’t
      gotten around to it until last week. Yes, I watched three seasons in a
      week! Alia Shawkat, my Arab American icon, I love her so much, is so so
      fucking good and I need her to be a leading lady in everything. The first
      season is the shiniest for me—the cringe humor is perfectly executed, the
      mystery is intriguing, and I really, really haven’t laughed that loud that
      consistently in such a long time. Season 2 and 3 are a little more
      stressful, a little messier, but still a good reward. I am really excited
      to see what the fourth season brings. Watch it on HBOMax.

    title02: The New Testament by Jericho Brown
    desc02: I’m 26 poetry books-deep for the Sealey Challenge, and *The New
      Testament* is definitely in my top 5 for the month! Jericho Brown is
      probably one of the most influential poets right now and I hadn’t spent
      too much time with his work, so this was just an incredible evening of
      reading. Every page was stunning. I wanted to underline it all. I want to
      close-read every poem and watch the perfect moments forever. You know the
      drill—[bookshop](https://bookshop.org/) or [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781556594571) for
      your copy! Many libraries are re-opening too!

    title01: Awesome ACNH resources
    desc01: Yes, I’m still playing Animal Crossing! Not every day, and not nearly as
      much as I did back in March, but I’m still very much loving it. [This doc
      of resources](https://github.com/skullface/awesome-acnh) is one of the
      best I’ve seen, and is helpful whether you’ve been playing for months or
      are just getting started—it’s got links to help you with everything from
      tracking turnip prices and planning hybrid flower gardens to finding cute
      custom designs and keeping track of which bugs you still need to catch.
      It’s a really good one-stop shop for any ACNH help you might need.

    title02: Three Gems Tea
    desc02: Lately I’ve been really into finding small tea businesses and trying out
      their different loose leaf teas, and my newest favorite is Three Gems Tea.
      I ordered their [6 oolong tea
      sampler](https://threegemstea.com/collections/tea/products/6-oolong-tea-sampler) and
      the ones I’ve tried so far are very yummy—I’m excited to pick a couple of
      favorites and order bigger bags of them. They also have a really
      cute [zine](https://threegemstea.com/products/3-is-a-magic-number-three-gems-tea-zine-1) for
      sale (you know we love zines here) and a [helpful brew
      guide](https://threegemstea.com/pages/brew-guide) on their website.
