  intro:
    summer: I’m currently writing the prospectus for my senior thesis & thinking
      about the massive amounts of literature I will have to go through this
      winter break—I’m also thinking about how a lot of the literary community
      that I currently have, and plan to write about, was in part thanks to
      Jill, whom I once called Queen of the Contemporary. For sure, I’m on the
      internet an obscene amount, and I have a poetry community at college, but
      I wouldn’t have a lot of the favorite books I do without Jill. I wouldn’t
      aspire to the very specific writing style I do (even in my academic work)
      without her, either. I’m carrying my friends with me in all this, and hope
      to carry all of you, too.
    jillian: 😭😭😭 Summer is the sweetest person on this planet and I love her.
      Anyway, let’s get into the good stuff.

    title01: Cento for the Night I Said, “I Love You,” by Nic Sealey
    desc01: Poetry twitter has been in a frenzy the past week over a horrendous
      plagiarism scandal. [This
      poem](https://pen.org/cento-night-said-love/) has been circulating as an
      example of the Right Way™ to use the work of other poets in your own. Its
      popularity is not confined to this moment though, since it’s pretty much
      the most beautiful love poem of all time. On top of being an incredibly
      difficult form, this poem makes me want to care so deeply about someone
      that I would put in that work. Read it with people you love.

    title02: "Cool Playlist Pod Episode 23: Gay Prom"
    desc02: Eliza Skinner’s Cool Playlist Podcast takes situations from the general
      to the hyper-specific and makes the ideal soundtrack. This episode, [Gay
      Prom](https://coolplaylistpod.com/2018/05/29/ep-23-gay-prom-with-cameron-esposito/),
      is the only one that’s made me break into tears. She and Cameron Esposito
      put together a beautiful playlist of gay artists to hit every moment in
      that fantasy prom, letting gay teens be normal and love and be loved. I
      won’t spoil which song it was, exactly, but the last moments…..it’s really
      good.

    title01: Friends With Secrets
    desc01: Sorry that all I do is talk about therapy all the time now! I’m one of
      those people! I’m not sure what to say about [Friends With
      Secrets](http://friendswithsecrets.com/) other than you need to see it.
      It’s an incredibly intimate, personal look into the online therapy
      sessions of three friends, and it’s the best thing on the internet right
      now. Reading it helped me realize some of the specific things I want to
      get out of my own therapy sessions, like what topics I want to touch on
      and how I want my therapist to react. Maybe it can do the same for you.

    title02: Vanderpump Rules
    desc02: >-
      It’s all about the pasta. If you for some reason aren’t watching
      Vanderpump Rules, what are you doing? It’s the only good TV show, and it
      just started its seventh season on Bravo. I’m about halfway through the
      sixth season right now, and I’m ready to preach the gospel of SUR to
      everyone who will listen.


      Vanderpump Rules is about (queen) Lisa Vanderpump, her many LA-based restaurants, and her staff—they have all dated, cheated on, broken up with, lied to, and backstabbed one another at some point over the years since the show began. And yet they remain close friends! I love it. I’m in a whole Slack dedicated to it. And I think you should love it too.
