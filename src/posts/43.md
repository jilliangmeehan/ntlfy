  intro:
    topic: community
    jillian: Sometimes I think the purest kind of joy is telling your friends to
      watch a show or read a book or play a game or listen to an album that you
      really, really love just so you can watch them fall in love with it too.
      So you can send incoherent messages back and forth to each other about how
      it makes you feel. So you can experience a thing that makes you feel like
      you’re on fire *together*. I guess that’s sort of why we started this
      newsletter—because sharing the things you like with the people you like is
      so, so good. It’s just a really funny, pleasant feeling to watch a TV
      series sweep through your friend group, picking off each person one by one
      until we’re all saturated with love for the same dumb thing. I want to
      bottle that feeling and experience it every single day, forever.
    summer: Online spaces have always been my biggest source of community; I have
      been so lucky to connect with people across my interests and never really
      feel alone, despite all of the times I have been lonely. In the early
      pandemic, there were lots of shifts with how people related to each other,
      realizing they could not see each other or touch—the majority of my
      longest, strongest friendships have taken place this way. My community is
      always with me and always away from me, our sync oscillating (different
      places in life, different interests, different time zones) but I always
      know we can fall back into a rhythm.

    title01: The Great
    desc01: "Very much in the vein of *The Favorite* (showrunned by the guy who
      wrote it) but maybe a little more earnest when it comes to girl power, The
      Great is a very fun pseudo-history about the Russian empress Catherine the
      Great, starring Elle Fanning. She’s so fucking good! Everyone in the cast
      is! My roommate and I picked this show for our mealtime routine, which was
      actually a bad idea because it’s really disgusting and has an incredible
      amount of vomiting, but! It was so fucking funny! I am so happy for Elle
      Fanning! My main descriptor: fun!!!! Love to have it. [Watch it on
      Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/the-great-238db0d4-c476-47ed-9bee-d326f\
      d302f7d)!"

    title02: "Falastin: A Cookbook"
    desc02: Sami Tamimi is the co-author of *Jerusalem,* a cookbook that has sat in
      my house since its release about ten years ago, heavily referenced and
      respected by my mom (the best cook in the world!). Now, he has taken the
      spotlight in his own cookbook (still co-authored) on Palestinian
      cooking. *Falastin* is beautiful and the recipes are really fucking good.
      I’ve only made a few things so far, but I’m so excited to try more!! The
      recipe index is also really awesome, especially for people unfamiliar with
      ingredients common in Arab cooking; what’s even better is it’s not just
      defining spices, it’s also defining terms,
      like [BDS](https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds) or OPT (occupied
      Palestinian territories)—these terms that describe the limitations of our
      movement, or the movements behind our liberation are as vital as olive oil
      or sumac or anything else. I recommend making the sweet tahini rolls, the
      dough is very good. Buy your copy
      on [bookshop](https://bookshop.org/books/falastin-a-cookbook/9780399581731) or [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399581731).

    title01: Netflix Party
    desc01: People have been talking about [Netflix
      Party](https://www.netflixparty.com/) since the beginning of quarantine
      (and probably before that, too!) as one of the ways to scratch the itch of
      hanging out with your friends when you can’t actually see them irl. I
      never actually tried it until this week, but now it’s my new favorite
      thing, thanks for asking. All you have to do is download the Chrome
      extension, open the movie or episode you want to watch on Netflix, and
      share the Netflix Party link with your friends so you watch and chat
      together. I’ve been using it to watch The Untamed with a couple of friends
      who have seen it before so we can all yell and cry about it together—pure
      joy!

    title02: Apply for your absentee ballot
    desc02: You may have heard, but there are less than 100 days until the election
      and we are still in the middle of a pandemic and USPS is having all kinds
      of issues, which is all just to say that you should probably apply for an
      absentee ballot sooner rather than later. (Yes, even if you think you
      might vote in person. Just do it anyway.) [This
      form](https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot/) on [vote.org](http://vote.org/) makes
      it very easy to do. I did it earlier this week! At the very least, I
      recommend looking up the deadline to request a ballot in your state and
      putting it on your calendar so you don’t forget.
