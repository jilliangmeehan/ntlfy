  intro:
    topic: learning
    jillian: "I love having hobbies more than anything else in the world, probably.
      And I am always, for some reason, looking for new ones. This year
      especially, I’ve been really excited about learning new things—I want to
      learn languages, I want to try knitting socks, I want to build a video
      game, I want to make different kinds of art, etc. etc. etc. But actually
      trying to learn a new skill is really overwhelming at first. I had all
      this energy and excitement about *learning* and *finding new hobbies*, but
      I didn’t know how or where to start. Mostly I started by thinking really
      hard about the things I wanted to do and talking to my therapist about it
      until she encouraged me to actually do something. So eventually, slowly, I
      started actually doing something: I downloaded Duolingo on my phone to
      learn languages, I looked for courses I could take or workshops I could do
      online to guide me through new programs, I thought about things I wanted
      to make or do so I could have an end goal in sight. I’m still overwhelmed,
      and I’m still buzzing with the energy of wanting to do every single thing
      in the world, but I feel more focused now. And I’m learning a lot, so
      there’s that."
    summer: Historically, I have been bad at picking up hobbies I did not have a
      natural inclination towards. I tried for many years to draw, made friends
      with other people drawing anime characters in the margins of their
      notebooks and posting the scribbles on deviantart, but never really got
      better. Eventually, I stopped. This was one of the skills I attempted
      while being in fandom; others included photo manipulation (fun, corny,
      best when visibly bad), making gifs (short learning curve), making fan
      videos (I was good at this). All of these were fun. Drawing, too, was fun,
      but eventually I stopped thinking of it as fondly as I should have. I have
      always loved writing and was praised for “writing well”; once writing
      poems stopped feeling as easy, I stopped, too—my taste was exceeding my
      talent, and I didn’t know how to work to catch up. I haven’t had much
      creative education, instead mostly “learning” on my own, “learning” from
      doing. I want to knit but am afraid of the learning curve, I want to
      tatreez but am anxious about wasting materials. I used to teach myself all
      kinds of things (for fandom purposes) but am not sure how to outside of
      the classroom, now. I want to! I want to learn more complex histories. I
      want to properly play an instrument. I want to learn outside of
      Capitalism™. I am just so tired.

    title01: Hades
    desc01: I’ve never had a better time dying in a game! Hades is a dungeon-crawler
      hack-and-slash where you play as the son of Hades, Zagreus, who wants to
      escape the Underworld and make it to the surface. Gameplay is just making
      escape attempts; at the end of each enemy-filled room is a gift—money,
      items, or a blessing from one of the gods of Olympus. You unlock story by
      repeating your escape attempts, talking to the residents of the House of
      Hades, and accepting gifts from the gods. The music is stunning, the cut
      scenes are stunning, the voice acting is SO GOOD?, and the combat is
      really, really fun. Before Hades, I was playing the Switch port of Super
      Mario Sunshine and was basically stuck on a lot of the platformer levels,
      getting frustrated with the monotony of dying. Hades is the perfect balm
      to that; it’s hard, but in the most satisfying way. Play it
      on [Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hades-switch/) or [PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/).

    title02: Strip by Jessica Abughattas
    desc02: This was one of the 2020 releases I was most excited for; *Strip* is a
      cool girl collection of poems that also makes you kinda sad and also
      pretty reflective and also just in awe of all of the incredible moves it
      makes. The Mitski of poetry books, the Phoebe Bridgers, even, we could
      say. I formally reviewed this book
      for [Anomaly](https://medium.com/anomalyblog/no-one-is-named-they-are-assigned-a-review-of-jessica-abughattas-strip-855a6016e12b),
      and just want to reiterate
      here: [buy](https://www.uapress.com/product/strip/)! [this](https://bookshop.org/books/strip-poems/9781682261484)! [book](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781682261484)!

    title01: 3d for Designers
    desc01: I heard about [this 3d art course](https://www.3dfordesigners.com/) from
      some friends and people I follow online, and it seemed like the perfect
      way to learn a new skill in a structured, helpful way. I thought about it
      for a while before I finally signed up a couple of months ago, and I’ve
      been slowly making my way through the lessons since then. If you think you
      might wanna learn how to make 3d art, I definitely recommend this
      course—but if there’s anything else you want to learn, consider looking
      around online for a course to guide you! I think online courses are very
      good, and definitely suit me way better than trying to find random
      tutorials on YouTube or something. And this one, in particular, is very
      cute and fun.

    title02: Genshin Impact
    desc02: "If you haven’t heard of [this game](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en),
      I’ll keep it brief: it’s like Breath of the Wild, but with cute anime
      girls and you can play it on your phone. It’s very fun and I love it. It’s
      also free, if you want it to be—yes, you can spend a little bit of money
      here and there to try to get certain characters or items that you want,
      but it’s just as good if you don’t. If you are like me and really like
      Breath of the Wild but haven’t come close to finishing it yet because it’s
      a little too overwhelming to even think about, you probably will love
      Genshin Impact. My preferred way to play is to pick up my iPad to do a
      couple of side quests during my lunch break each day."
